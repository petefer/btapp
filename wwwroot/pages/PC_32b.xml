something. (3) “Ontic distinctness”: what makes human being distinct as a thing among other things is that
human beings (3.1) are concerned about their own being and (3.2) understand the being of themselves and of
thing other than themselves. (4) At stake: Something is at stake when it has been wagered (promised, pledged,
lent out) and can be lost.">◊</span>
consists in the fact that our very ex-sistence is to be <i>concerned</i> about
that ex-sistence: our ex-sistence is at stake for us. We have—and <i>are</i>—a relation to our own ex-sisting.
Hence with some degree of explicitness we do understand our ex-sistence: it is somehow intelligible to us.
<i>Understanding our own being [along with the being of everything else] goes with ex-sistence</i>.
<span style="color:magenta;" title="The being that is referred to here is not just our being (ex-sistence); this becomes
clear in what follows. Being-in-the-world includes in itself ex-sistence’s relation to the whole of being: it
includes the understanding of such being. [See Editor’s note. ◊]

We are <i>ontically</i> distinct [i.e., as things] in that we are <i>onto-logical</i> [i.e., we understand being].
