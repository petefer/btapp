<b>2. <i>Ex-sistence is somehow intelligible to itself.</i></b> Ex-sistence does not merely <i>occur</i> [<i>vorkommt</i>] among other
things. Rather, our ontic distinctness consists in the fact that our very ex-sistence is to be <i>concerned</i> about
that ex-sistence: our ex-sistence is at stake for us. We have—and <i>are</i>—a relation to our own ex-sisting.
Hence with some degree of explicitness we do understand our ex-sistence: it is somehow intelligible to us.
<i>Understanding our own being [along with the being of everything else] goes with ex-sistence</i>.
<span title="The being that is referred to here is not just our being (ex-sistence); this becomes
clear in what follows. Being-in-the-world includes in itself ex-sistence’s relation to the whole of being: it
includes the understanding of such being. [See Editor’s note. * ]

We are <i>ontically</i> distinct [i.e., as things] in that we are <i>onto-logical</i> [i.e., we understand being].
