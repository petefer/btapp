<b>39. <i>The language of SZ.</i></b> As regards the awkward and “inelegant” language of this book, we may
say this much: It is one thing to simply tell a story about things
 and quite another to understand
the <i>being</i> of things,. That is a task for which we currently lack both the vocabulary and the
“grammar.”
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; When we compare the ontological sections of Plato's <i>Parmenides</i> or Aristotle's
<i>Metaphysics</i> VII with the narrative sections of Thucydides' <i>History of the Peloponnesian War</i>, we
cannot help but be struck by how strange was the philosophical jargon that Plato and Aristotle
inflicted on the Greek language. Today, the problems of ontology have become much harder than
they were for the Greeks even as our philosophical powers have become weaker. Therefore, it is
virtually inevitable that the concepts in this text will be complex and that the way we express them
will be equally rough.
