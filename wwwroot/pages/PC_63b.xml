<b>39. <i>The language of SZ.</i></b> The language of this book is awkward and “inelegant” because it does not report about things
but grasps being*. If we compare the ontological sections of Plato’s <i>Parmenides</i> or Aristotle’s <i>Metaphysics</i> VII with a
narrative section of Thucydides, we can see the unprecedented formulations that Plato and Aristotle inflicted on the
Greeks. Today our philosophical powers are weaker than theirs, and the ontological problems are more difficult for us
than for the Greeks. Accordingly the complexity of our concept-formations and the severity of our expression will
increase.
