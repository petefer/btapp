<b>17. <i>SZ II.3: Aristotle on time.</i></b> Within the limited scope of SZ we will not give a detailed ur-temporal interpretation of
the foundations of ancient ontology either in general or at its scientific apex in Aristotle. Instead, by interpreting his
Aristotle’s treatise on time (<i>Physics</i> IV 10, 217b29 – 14, 224a17), we will discern the basis and limits of the Greek
science of being.
