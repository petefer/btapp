<b>13. <i>SZ II.2: Descartes (continued).</i></b> The Meditations overlooked the being of the <i>sum</i> and instead regard the
<i>res cogitans sive mens sive animus</i> [the self as a thinking thing or mind or spirit]
<span title="Descartes adds: <i>sive intellectus sive ratio</i> (“or intellect or reason”),
<i>Oeuvres Complètes de René Descartes: Meditationes de prima philosophia</>, VII, 28.">◊</span>
as a <i>fundamentum inconcussum</i>, an
unshakeable foundation, to which he merely applied medieval Suarezian ontology. He defined the <i>res cogitans</i> as an
ens, which in medieval philosophy meant an <i>ens creatum</i> as over against God as the <i>ens increatum</i>. (Note that
createdness = <i>pro-duced-ness</i>, which is an essential item in the ancient conception of being.)
<br/>
Instead of a new beginning, Descartes burdened modern philosophy with an ill-fated traditional prejudice that long
blocked the way to what SZ intends to do, viz., (1) work out an ontology of mind [= SZ I.1-2] in the light of (2) urtemporality
[= SZ I.3] and then (3) use that as the key to engaging critically with ancient ontology [= SZ II].
