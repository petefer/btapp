<b>12. <i>Clarifying the in-itself-ness of things.</i></b>
When we say a tool “doesn’t stand out,” that seemingly privative or
negative phrase actually says something positive, namely, that in not standing out the tool is “holding itself in,” by
which we mean: it manifests its <i>in-itself-ness</i>. It’s acting just like what it is: a usable tool. Traditionally the term “initself-
ness” or “inseity” is used of objectively present things, but if we use the objectively present as our model, we
will never understand the crucial issue of a tool’s in-itself-ness. Even though it is a term for being, in-itself-ness is
usually used in an <i>ontic</i> sense, which clarifies nothing. As we have been arguing, only an analysis of the world of
meaning can clarify ontologically the in-itself-ness of things.
