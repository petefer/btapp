<b>14. <i>One’s lived environment (Umwelt).</i></b> Each of us has a “lived environment” [<i>Umwelt</i>], <sup>*</sup> but we are <i>able</i> to
have such environments only because we are always already engaged with meaning. That engagement enables
to understand and use the things in our environment and thus to “have” an environment. Ontically “having a
lived environment” is a somewhat obvious fact; but the very <i>having</i> of such an environment is an ontological
problem that can be solved only if we adequately understand human being as ex-sistence.

Biologists (e.g., Karl von Baer) <sup>*</sup> speak of “lived environments.” We, however, use this term
philosophically rather than biologically. Biology presumes and employs the notion of a lived environment
without clarifying its <i>being</i>. <sup>¶</sup> We will demonstrate the apriority of the lived environment by showing
philosophically that having such an environment is a structure of ex-sistence. That lets us define “biological
life” as a <i>privative</i> form of ex-sistence taken as the a priori engagement with meaning in the form of concern
about things.
