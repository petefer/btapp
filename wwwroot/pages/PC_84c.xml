<b>14. <i>One’s lived environment (Umwelt).</i></b> Each of us has a “lived environment” [<i>Umwelt</i>],
<span style="color:magenta;" title="In fact we have more than one, for example: family, neighborhood,
job, political, social, or religious associations, and so on.">◊</span>
but we are <i>able</i> to
have such environments only because we are always already engaged with meaning. That engagement enables
to understand and use the things in our environment and thus to “have” an environment. Ontically “having a
lived environment” is a somewhat obvious fact; but the very <i>having</i> of such an environment is an ontological
problem that can be solved only if we adequately understand human being as ex-sistence.

Biologists (e.g., Karl von Baer)
<span style="color:magenta;" title="The German-Russian biologist (and opponent of natural selection)
discovered the mammalian ovary in 1826. He influenced Jakob von Uexküll, whose work in turn influenced
Heidegger (see GA 21: 215 = 181; GA 29/30: 285 = 192 etc.)">◊</span>
speak of “lived environments.” We, however, use this term
philosophically rather than biologically. Biology presumes and employs the notion of a lived environment
without clarifying its <i>being</i>.<span title="Can we even justifiably call this a “world”? It’s merely what is given as
the animal’s surroundings! The only world the animal “has” is what is “given” [as its surroundings]. Exsistence
never “has” a world. [German: Ist da überhaupt mit Recht von “Welt” di Rede? Nur Umgebung!
Dieser “Gebe” ensprifcht di “Habe.” Da-sein “hat” niemals Welt.]">☞</span> We will demonstrate the apriority of the lived environment by showing
philosophically that having such an environment is a structure of ex-sistence. That lets us define “biological
life” as a <i>privative</i> form of ex-sistence taken as the a priori engagement with meaning in the form of concern
about things.
