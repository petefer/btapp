<b>30. <i>Three ways a phenomenon can be “hidden.”</i></b> There are three ways that either a thing or its
being/significance can be “hidden.”
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. It can be absolutely unknown, not yet undiscovered, hence not known at all and, in a
strict sense, not even <i>un</i>known.
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. It can have been known before, but now completely forgotten.
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. It can have been forgotten, then “remembered,” but remembered in a distorted form as
a mere semblance, an appearance-2, of the original thing. This form of hiddenness is
the most common, most dangerous, and most difficult to overcome.
<br/>
As regards no. 3 immediately above, even a semblance , distorted and distorting as it is, can and
does function as what and how a thing “really is.” This is especially the case with the structures of
being when systems of philosophy present those structures as “utterly clear” and requiring no
justification—and then go on to deduce a raft of conclusions from them.
