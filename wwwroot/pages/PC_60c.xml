<b>30. <i>Three ways a phenomenon can be covered up.</i></b> A phenomenon can be covered up in various ways:<br />
 1. hidden: by being undiscovered, neither known or unknown;<br />
 2. forgotten: by being “covered up again” after it has been discovered;<br />
 3. distorted: by being (qua covered up again) either completely out of sight or (more
likely) visible but disguised in the form of a semblance. (But where there is semblance,
there is the being of the thing.) Semblance, as “distortion,” is frequent, dangerous, and stubborn.<br />
In philosophical “systems” such concealed structures of being come across as “clear,” in no need of justification, and as
the starting point of various deductions.
