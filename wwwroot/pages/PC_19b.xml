<b>2. <i>An unasked and unanswered question.</i></b> Nowadays we have no answer to the question of what it means
that something <i>is</i> or <i>has being</i>—and we are not even troubled by the fact that we don’t know. So we must
renew the question. Our goal in this book is to work out concretely the question of what accounts for “being”
at all. Our provisional aim<sup>¶</sup> is to show that <i>time</i> is what accounts for our ability to have any understanding
of being.<sup>¶</sup>
<br/>
¶ <b>2, provisional aim</b>: “Provisional” because it is the immediate aim of SZ I, whereas SZ II will take a further
step and use “time” as the clue for dismantling the history of ontology.<br />
¶ <b>2, time is what accounts for…understanding of being</b>: Literally, “time is the possible horizon for
understanding being at all.” Here “possible” is not set in contrast to “actual” but instead means “that which
makes possible” (ermöglicht) the understanding of being.
