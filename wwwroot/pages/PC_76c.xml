<b>3. <i>Needed: a “natural” conception of the world of meaning.</i></b> It is easy to show how ontological research differs
formally from ontic research, but the difficulty lies in how to begin such an analysis (not to mention how to
develop it).
<br/>
For that, we need to work out a “natural” concept of the world of meaning.
<span title="Heidegger uses the German word “Welt,” which I here
render as “the world of meaning” insofar as Heidegger will soon show that by “Welt” he does not mean the
universe or planet Earth or just the things surrounding us in space and time but instead a region of
meaningfulness, significance, intelligibility, as in “the world of a carpenter” or “the world of a student.”">◊</span>
The amount of information we
have about human ex-sistence is overwhelming and can seduce us into missing the real problem. We do not get
to an essence (i.e., the way something <i>is</i>) by comparing things and then ordering and classifying their common
aspects. All ordering of things presupposes a <i>prior principle</i> of the ordering. [We live in “worlds of meaning”],
and to get meaningfulness itself—the essence of all such worlds of meaning—we first must find the <i>principle</i>
that underlies the ordering of these worlds. The <i>world of meaning</i>, in our sense of the term, is something that
<i>constitutes</i> ex-sistence; therefore, we need to grasp the basic structures of ex-sistence if we want to understand
meaning.
