<b>9. <i>The result: the being of man has been overlooked.</i></b> Both Christianity and Greek philosophy treat the
human being as a thing and overlook the human mode of being—or else just treat humans as objectively present

becomes the <i>res cogitans</i>, the mind as a “thinking thing” and the interconnectedness of its experiences. But the
being of the <i>cogitationes</i> is either left undefinted or assumed to be obvious and in no need of philosophical
inquiry. Hence the foundations of the various theories of human being remain unstable.
