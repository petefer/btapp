<b>15. <i>The many meaning of logos.</i></b> Given its many meanings in Plato and Aristotle, the word <i>logos</i>
might seem to lack a basic unified sense. However, the contrary is true. The following paragraphs
present what that basic meaning is. One might claim that the fundamental meaning of <i>logos</i> is the
ability to speak—or even that it is speech itself—but that remains all too vague unless and until
we first find out what speech or talk <i>is</i>.<span style="color:magenta;" title="Heidegger's interpretations of logos in Aristotle are generally consistent throughout his work. See, for example, GA 18: 45-62 = 32-44.">◊</span>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The meaning of <i>logos</i> in Plato and Aristotle has been obscured by the later history of the
word and by subsequent philosophical interpretations. We might well wonder how this one word
came to have such a variety of meanings, for example:
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; • the faculty of reason [<i>Vernunft</i>]
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; • the judgment [<i>Urteil</i>] underlying an assertion / proposition / declarative sentence.
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; • a concept [<i>Begriff</i>]
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; • a definition [<i>Definition</i>]
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; • the reason or grounds for something [<i>Grund;</i> Latin <i>ratio</i>]
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; • relationship [<i>Verhältnis</i>].
<br/>
It might <i>seem</i> legitimate to translate <i>logos</i> as “statement” or “proposition” in the sense of a
declarative sentence that expresses a judgment, but that misses the basic meaning of the term. In
its original Greek sense, the primary meaning of <i>logos</i> is not a judgment, especially not the way
that term is used in current epistemological theories of judgment. A judgment is not a matter of
merely combining a subject and a predicate while affirming or denying something. In what
follows, we sort out five possible functions of <i>logos</i>.
