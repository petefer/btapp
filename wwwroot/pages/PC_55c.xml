<b>15. <i>Searching for the original meaning of λόγoς.</i></b> It only <i>seems</i> that in Plato and Aristotle λόγoς has many meanings
without having a basic, guiding meaning. One meaning of λόγoς is “discursivity” (<i>Rede</i>), but we cannot validate that
fact until we first find out what “discourse” is.

The meaning of λόγoς has been covered up by the later history of the word and by subsequent philosophical
interpretations of it as meaning: reason, judgment, concept, definition, ground, and relationship. True, λόγoς <i>can</i> mean
all those things. But even “assertion <i>qua</i> judgment,” which <i>seems</i> to be a legitimate sense of λόγoς, misses the basic
meaning of the term, especially if we use contemporary theories of judgment such as “combining” one thing with
another or “taking a position” by affirming or denying something.
