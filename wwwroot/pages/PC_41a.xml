<b>1. <i>Ex-sistential historicity makes possible ex-sistentiel-personal history.</i></b> Scientific research, including fundamental
ontology, is an ontic possibility of ex-sistence. How does that pertain to the science of history [<i>Historie</i>]?
<br/>
Ex-sistence <i>qua</i> temporal is our way of being; in turn, it makes possible historicity [<i>Geschichtlichkeit</i>] as another
element of our way of being. Historicity—i.e., <i>being</i> historical—is prior to and the foundation for living one’s own
personal history.<sup>¶</sup> Historicity is the ex-sistential way of being that (1) allows us to have and to live an ex-sistentiel-personal
history and that (2) makes it possible for us to have a “world history.”
<br/>

¶ <b>1, living one’s history</b>: More literally: “history in the sense of living [one’s] history in the world.” Following this
sentence, Macquarrie-Robinson incorrectly inserts a paragraph break that does not appear in the German.
