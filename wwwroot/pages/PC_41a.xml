<b>1. <i>Ex-sistential historicity makes possible ex-sistentiel-personal history.</i></b> Scientific research, including fundamental
ontology, is an ontic possibility of ex-sistence. How does that pertain to the science of history [<i>Historie</i>]?
</p>
<p id="PC_41a">
Ex-sistence qua temporal is our way of being; in turn, it makes possible historicity [<i>Geschichtlichkeit</i>] as another
element of our way of being. Historicity—i.e., <i>being</i> historical—is prior to and the foundation for living one’s own
personal history.n Historicity is the ex-sistential way of being that (1) allows us to have and to live an ex-sistentielpersonal
history and that (2) makes it possible for us to have a “world history.”

<b>“Alreadiness” and the past.</b> Factically I always am “what” and how I <i>already</i> am [“wie und ‘was’ es schon war”].n
This entails that, whether I am aware of it or not, I always already am my <i>past</i>—but not like some possession that I drag
along behind me that still occasionally affects me. No, I <i>am</i> my past: it is an element of my way of being. Moreover, (to
put it roughly) my past “happens” from out of my future.<sup>n</sup>

<p id="PC_41a">
Regardless of how I now am and currently understand my ex-sistence, I have grown up <i>into</i> and <i>in</i> an <i>inherited</i>
way of understanding myself. That is how I first and foremost understand myself, it’s how I see and regulate my
possibilities. My inherited past—which is always <i>social</i>, i.e., the past of my “generation” (Dilthey)—does not follow
along <i>behind</i> me but always already goes <i>ahead</i> of me.<sup>n</sup>
