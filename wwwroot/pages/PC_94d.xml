<b>17. <i>Terminology; division of the material.</i></b> We will use the term “lived world” (<i>Umwelt</i>) to name any of the everyday
worlds of meaning that we inhabit. We will study such lived worlds as a way of getting at the structure of meaning as
such. The German prefix <i>“um</i>-” (“around”) in the term <i>Umwelt</i> does not mean the physical space around us but refers
to ex-sistential spatiality, which we referred to above in § 12 (SZ 53g, 56b) and will clarify below in terms of meaning.

<p id="PC_94d">
• Section A will analyze how we deal with the practical things we first encounter in our lived worlds of
meaning.
</p>
<p id="PC_94d">
• Section B will show that Descartes’ notion of the world as <i>res extensa</i> vs. <i>res cogitans</i> was an attempt to
explain spatiality, but overlooked ex-sistence.
</p>
<p id="PC_94d">
• Section C will explain the peculiar spatiality of ex-sistence and of our lived worlds of meaning.
