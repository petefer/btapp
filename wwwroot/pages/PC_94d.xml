<b>17. <i>Terminology; division of the material.</i></b> We will use the term “lived world” (<i>Umwelt</i>) to name any of the everyday
worlds of meaning that we inhabit. We will study such lived worlds as a way of getting at the structure of meaning as
such. The German prefix <i>“um</i>-” (“around”) in the term <i>Umwelt</i> does not mean the physical space around us but refers
to ex-sistential spatiality, which we referred to above in § 12 (SZ 53g, 56b) and will clarify below in terms of meaning.
<br/>
• Section A will analyze how we deal with the practical things we first encounter in our lived worlds of
meaning.
<br/>
• Section B will show that Descartes’ notion of the world as <i>res extensa</i> vs. <i>res cogitans</i> was an attempt to
explain spatiality, but overlooked ex-sistence.
<br/>
• Section C will explain the peculiar spatiality of ex-sistence and of our lived worlds of meaning.
<br/>
<i>How this chapter will unfold.</i> Chapter Three progresses as follows:
<br/>
Section A, § § 15-18: The lived world of meaning and its essential structure
<br/>
Section B, § § 19-21: Our position contrasted with that of Descartes
<br/>
Section C, § § 22-24: The spatiality of ex-sistence and of the lived world of meaning
