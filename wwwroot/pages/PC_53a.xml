<b>8. <i>Why these are not true phenomena.</i></b> Neither the symptom nor the disease are true phenomena in the sense of “selfshowing.”<br />
 • The symptom is not a true phenomenon because what it <i>primarily</i> does is “announce the disease” rather than showing <i>itself</i>.<br />
 • The disease is not a true phenomenon because it shows up only <i>indirectly</i> through the symptom.<br />
The primary sense of phenomenon is <i>presupposed</i> in such cases insofar as the symptom (a rash) <i>does show up</i>.
Nonetheless, in this case that primary sense of phenomenon is hidden insofar as:<br />
 • the rash, as the so-called “appearance of the disease,” is not a direct <i>self</i>-showing of the disease [since
the disease appears only indirectly through the symptom]; and<br />
 • the so-called “appearance of the symptom” is indeed a real self-showing <i>of the rash</i>, but the
significance of the rash consists in <i>indicating the disease</i>, which does not directly show up.<br />
Critiques of phenomenology often are unclear on the meaning of “appearance” and thus confuse a true phenomenon
with a symptom.
