<b>8. <i>Appearance-3 depends on (but is not) a genuine phenomenon.</i></b> 
The third sense of “phenomenon”
presumes the first and genuine sense, even though appearance-1 and appearance-3 are very
different. A rash (an appearance-2), for example, <i>presupposes</i> the primary and genuine sense of
phenomenon insofar as the rash, as a symptom, does indeed show up as what it is, namely as a
rash. However, in an appearance-3 <i>that</i> primary sense remains suppressed insofar as the rash
indicates something else that remains hidden. Note, then, that the term “appearance-3” can have
two meanings:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. The proper meaning: It can refer to the <i>symptom</i> that indicates the hidden disease,
without that disease appearing on its own.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. The derivative meaning: It can also refer to the indirect appearance 
<i>of the hidden disease</i> through the symptom.
<br />
The up-shot is this:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; • The proper meaning of appearance-3 never applies to appearance-1. That is,
appearance-1 is never an appearance through which something hidden manifests itself
while remaining hidden. There is nothing hiding “behind” a genuine phenomenon.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; • But every appearance-3 in its proper meaning (e.g., a symptom that indicates something
hidden) presupposes and depends on an appearance-1 insofar as the symptom (e.g., a
rash), besides indicating something hidden, <i>does</i> show up as what it is: a rash.
<br />
Critiques of phenomenology frequently confuse the various meanings of the word “appearance”
and thereby make a hash of things.
