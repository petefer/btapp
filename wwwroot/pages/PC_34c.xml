<b>10. <i>Our personal-ex-sistentiel life is the basis of this entire investigation.</i></b> This book’s ontological-exsistenti<i>al</i>
analysis has its roots in ex-sistence qua ontic-ex-sistenti<i>el</i>; that is, we are indeed things
(“entities,” hence ontic), but things that understand being (hence onto-logical). Therefore, we have to<br />
  1. show that ex-sistence—in its ex-sistenti<i>al</i> structure—entails the personal-ex-sistenti<i>el</i>
possibility of conducting an ontological inquiry;<br />
  2. then, through that inquiry, disclose ex-sistence’s ex-sistenti<i>al</i> structure; and thus<br />
  3. acquire an adequately grounded set of problems [leading to a full fundamental ontology].<br />
In showing the ontic priority of ex-sistence in this section, we have also established the ontic priority of the
question “How is being intelligible?”
