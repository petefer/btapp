<b>11. <i>The structure of the world: meaningfulness as such.</i></b>
The relations we have been discussing are disclosed beforehand
in an act of understanding (a topic we will analyze more thoroughly in § 31). Understanding those relations means
maintaining a familiarity with them. I hold them “in front of me”: I live into them and let myself be referred and
related through them. Those referrals are relations that <i>make sense</i> of things, and through familiarity with them I make
sense of myself, my ex-sistence, my engagement with meaning, and my ability and need to become myself.
<br/>
The whole chain of means-to-ends referrals is a concatenation of sense-making. The final purpose lends meaning
to certain tasks, which in turn lend meaning to the tools for carrying them out. The referrals as a whole are an ensemble
of sense-making relations in terms of which I understand myself as fundamentally engaged with meaning. We call
this ensemble <i>meaningfulness as such</i>. It is the very structure of the world that I, as ex-sistence, am always already
in.

    As familiar with meaningfulness as such, we are the ontic condition that makes it possible (1) for things to be discovered
    as suitable / useful and (2) for this usefulness to be seen as the in-itself-ness of those things.
</i> The fact that we ex-sist entails
two things: (1) that we always already discover an ensemble of useful things in their being and (2) that we are always already
referred

and are <i>dependent</i> upon things in our very ex-sistence.
