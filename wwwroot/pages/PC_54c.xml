<b>12. <i>Summary: the four kinds of phenomena.</i></b> We have now distinguished four kinds of
appearances:
<br/>
• appearance-1: a genuine appearance: a “phenomenon” in the strict sense of the term:
something that appears to us as itself;
<br/>
• appearance-2: a specious appearance: a mere semblance, an appearance that is founded
on a genuine phenomenon but distorts it;
<br/>
• appearance-3: an appearance (e.g., a symptom) that indicates something else that
remains hidden: this, too, is founded on a genuine phenomenon;
<br/>
• appearance-4: a “mere appearance” à la Kant.
<br/>
In order to be clear on these distinctions, we need more precision on what a genuine phenomenon
is in the <i>phenomenological</i> sense. The <i>phenomenological</i> concept of a phenomenon combines two
elements. It is the unity of <i>what</i> shows up (the thing) and <i>how</i> it shows up (the way the thing is
present and significant to us).
