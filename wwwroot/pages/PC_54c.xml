<b>12. <i>The three other instances of phenomenon are founded on the first (= the genuine) instance.</i></b> A phenomenon
(something that shows up in and of itself) is a distinctive way that something can be encountered. In the case of a
symptom manifesting a disease (that is, an appearance-through-another [= number 3 in the chart]), a <i>genuine</i>
phenomenon is required [the symptom must show up]. Both appearance-through-another [number 3] and semblance
[number 2] are founded on genuine phenomena as self-showing [number 1]. We must first understand what constitutes
a <i>genuine</i> phenomenon if we hope to sort out and distinguish<br />
 • semblance [number 2]<br />
 • appearance-through-another [number 3]<br />
 • mere appearance [number 4].<br />
