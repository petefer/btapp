<b>8. <i>The positive and negative aims of this destruction.</i></b> We will display the birth certificate, so to speak, of our basic
concepts of being. This is neither to relativize ontological viewpoints nor to throw off the tradition. Instead,<br />
 • <i>positively</i>, we seek (1) to find the genuine possibilities embedded in the tradition and (2) to keep the tradition
within its limits as regards its formulation of the question and its demarcation of the field.<br />
 • <i>negatively</i>, we are aiming not at the past but at today’s treatment of ontology (whether doxography,<sup>n</sup>
intellectual history, or the history of problems). We do not aim to annihilate the past.<br />
Our aim is positive, while its negative function remains implicit and indirect.
