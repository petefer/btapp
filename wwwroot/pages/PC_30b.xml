<b>6. <i>A science’s basic concepts are confirmed by a regional ontology qua “productive logic.”</i></b> That is to say:<br />
  • The basic concepts of a science provide an understanding of a <i>region</i> of things.<br />
  • In turn these concepts can be confirmed by a <i>prior ontological inquiry</i> into that region (a “regional
ontology”)—the way Plato and Aristotle interpreted the being of the things within specific regions
[e.g., Aristotle’s <i>Physics</i>].<br />
  • Such a regional ontology is a “productive logic” (not just a “methodological logic”), one that
makes sense of the being of the things within a specific region and thus makes those things
available to the positive sciences.<br />
<b>Two examples.</b> In the science of history a “productive logic” would get to the <i>being</i> of humans as
<i>historical</i>, i.e., their very “historicity” [as in SZ § 74], in contrast to merely theories about historical
knowledge or the things this science studies. Another example of a “productive logic” is the transcendental
logic of Kant’s <i>Critique of Pure Reason</i>, which gets to the being of Newtonian nature.
