<b>11. <i>Taking something as a sign.</i></b>
Another and more basic way of “setting up a sign” is to <i>take</i> something as a sign—
something in nature, for example, that already affects us. We have said that a sign, in indicating something, renders a
whole ensemble of things <i>and</i> their world of meaning available for foresight and use. But it can also discover
something new regarding phenomena that are we’re already familiar with.

An example: The farmer is already familiar with the south wind: for him it’s never just an objectively present
meteorological phenomenon. When he notes that the south wind will bring rain tonight, he is not “adding” that on to
something objectively present. Rather, it’s <i>concern for his crop</i> that first lets him notice the south wind as a sign of
rain.
