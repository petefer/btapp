<b>7. <i>The destruction of the history of ontology.</i></b> To understand the history of the question of being, we must loosen up the
sclerotic tradition of ontology and undo its concealments. Taking the question of being as our clue, we shall <i>destroy</i> the
traditional content of ancient ontology so as to get to the original experiences in which the classical Greeks [= Plato and
Aristotle] determined the nature of being and by which we have been guided ever since.
