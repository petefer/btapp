<b>9. <i>The referral-structure of a job (1): the “what-for” (τὸ τέλος).</i></b>
Say I want to make a bookcase. The product I want
to make—the bookcase—is the “what-for” of the tool. In addition, that product itself has <i>its own</i> what-for and its own
usefulness: it’s for holding books. I undertake the job to produce something of use, and with that comes the whole
context of referrals that make up the job to be done.
