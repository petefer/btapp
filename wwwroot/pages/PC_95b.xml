<b>1. <i>Beginning with our practical dealings with things.</i></b> To show the being of what we first encounter in our engagement
with meaning, we will study our <i>practical dealings</i> with things in our lived worlds of meaning. These dealings include
many forms of involvement and concern, the most immediate of which is not detached perceiving of “objects out
there” but rather <i>using</i> things, handling them, doing something with them. Such practical concerns have their 
<i>own particular kind of knowing</i>. We now ask how about the <i>being</i> of these objects of practical concern: How are they
<i>meaningfully present</i> to us? — But first a remark about method.
