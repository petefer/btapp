<b>4. <i>First: “Being is the most universal”—but not as a genus.</i></b> Aristotle says that being
<span title="That is, what-has-being, beingness [German: das Seiend, die Seiendheit].">☞</span>
[ὄν, the condition
of “having-being”] is the “most universal” concept;<sup>1 2</sup>
<span title="Heidegger adds: τὸ ὄν ἐστι καθόλου μάλιστα πάντων, which he derives
from Metaphysics II 4, 1001a21, which reads: ταῦτα [= τὸ ἓν καὶ τὸ ὄν] καθόλου μάλιστα πάντων. “These
two [i.e., both “one” and “is/has being”] are the most universal of all things.”">◊</span>
and Aquinas writes that “ens” [“having-being”] is what
we first apprehend in everything we apprehend.<sup>3</sup>
<span title="Heidegger cites Aquinas’ Latin: “Illud quod primo cadit sub
apprehensione est ens, cuius intellectus includitur in omnibus, quaecumque quis apprehendit” (Summa
theologiae I-II, 94, 2, c.): “Being” [i.e., the condition of “having-being”] is what is apprehended first of all.
The understanding of “being” is included in everything we apprehend, no matter what the thing may be.">◊</span>
This universality, however, this is not the universality
of a <i>genus</i>.
<span title="Heidegger adds: οὔτε τὸ ὂν γένος [neither is having-being a genus],
taken from Metaphysics B 3, 998b 22, where the complete text is: οὐχ ὃιόν τε δὲ τῶν ὄντων ἓν εἶναι γένος
οὔτε τὸ ἓν οὔτε τὸ ὄν. “Neither of these two kinds of things—neither oneness nor having-being—[can] be a
genus.”">◊</span>
οὔτε τὸ ὂν γένος [being is not a genus]. Rather, being (ὄν, <i>ens</i>) transcends genera and species: it
is <i>transcendens</i>, a “transcendental” [in the medieval scholastic sense of the term].
<br/>
Aristotle envisions the unity underlying all instances of being not in terms the highest genus of
things but rather as a unity of <i>analogy</i>. His analogical approach placed the question of being on a new
foundation (even though it depended on Plato’s formulation of the question). But Aristotle, along with the
medieval Thomists and the Scotists, failed to clarify the analogy of being. Later Hegel’s <i>Logic</i> interpreted
being as the “indeterminate immediate” and the basis for all other categories; but Hegel generates a
<i>multiplicity</i> of categories rather than an analogical <i>unity</i>.
<br/>
Hence, to call being (i.e., the metaphysical “is” of things) the “most universal” leaves it obscure and in
need of discussion.
