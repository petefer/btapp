<b>4. <i>First: “Being is the most universal”—but not as a genus.</i></b> Aristotle says that being<sup>¶</sup> [ὄν, the condition
of “having-being”] is the “most universal” concept;<sup>1 2</sup> and Aquinas writes that “ens” [“having-being”] is what
we first apprehend in everything we we apprehend.<sup>3</sup> This universality, however, this is not the universality
of a <i>genus</i>. οὔτε τὸ ὂν γένος [being is not a genus]. Rather, being (ὄν, <i>ens</i>) transcends genera and species: it
is <i>transcendens</i>, a “transcendental” [in the medieval scholastic sense of the term].

Aristotle envisions the unity underlying all instances of being not in terms the highest genus of
things but rather as a unity of <i>analogy</i>. His analogical approach placed the question of being on a new
foundation (even though it depended on Plato’s formulation of the question). But Aristotle, along with the
medieval Thomists and the Scotists, failed to clarify the analogy of being. Later Hegel’s <i>Logic</i> interpreted
being as the “indeterminate immediate” and the basis for all other categories; but Hegel generates a
<i>multiplicity</i> of categories rather than an analogical <i>unity</i>.

Hence, to call being (i.e., the metaphysical “is” of things) the “most universal” leaves it obscure and in
need of discussion.
