<b>4. <i>First: “Being is the most universal”—but not as a genus.</i></b> Aristotle calls being<sup>1</sup> (ὄν) the “most
universal” concept,<sup>n</sup> and Aquinas says that being (<i>ens</i>) is what the mind encounters first of all and
everywhere;<sup>n</sup> however, this is not the universality of a genus.<sup>n</sup> Rather, being (ὄν, <i>ens</i>) transcends genera and
species: it is transcendens, a “transcendental” in the medieval scholastic sense of the term.

Aristotle envisions the unity underlying all instances of being not as the highest genus of things but
rather as the <i>unity of analogy</i>. His analogical approach placed the question of being on a new foundation
(even though it depended on Plato’s formulation of the question). But Aristotle, along with the medieval
Thomists and the Scotists, failed to clarify the analogy of being. Later Hegel’s <i>Logic</i> interpreted being as
the “indeterminate immediate” and the basis for all other categories; but Hegel generates a multiplicity of
categories rather than an analogical <i>unity</i>.

Hence, to call being (i.e., the metaphysical “is” of things) the “most universal” leaves it obscure and in
need of discussion.
