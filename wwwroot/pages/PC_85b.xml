<b>15. <i>Summary.</i></b> So far we have shown what the engagement with meaning is <i>not</i>, but only in order to eventually
point out its <i>positive</i> charcteristics. Our phenomenological approach cuts through the disguises that conceal our
engagement with meaning in everyday life. Because the engagement with meaning is a basic state of our exsistence,
it shows up so much throughout our everydayness that it lends itself to false interpretations

(which paradoxically are possible only <i>because</i> we are engaged with meaning). 
The problem goes back to the fact we
usually understand ourselves in terms of the <i>things</i> that we meet within the world of meaning.

the things we meet. [German: Eine Rückdeutung.]
