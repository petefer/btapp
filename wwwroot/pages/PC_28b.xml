<b>12. <i>The unique reciprocity of ex-sistence and being.</i></b> The question about what accounts for being is not
circular but rather is a matter of reciprocity [<i>reci-proci-tas</i>], a “remarkable back-and-forth relation”
<span title="The etymology of “reciprocity” is precisely such
a “back-and-forth-ness” (reci-proci-tas). In the 1930s Heidegger will call this back-and-forth relation a
“Gegenschwung” (oscillation), i.e., the reciprocal sameness, the unified either/or of Da-sein (ex-sistence is
the clearing) and Da-sein (the clearing that ex-sistence is). See GA 65: 29.15 et passim; GA 70: 126.18; GA
75: 59.15; GA 78: 335.13, etc.; and cf. GA 26: 270.4-5.">◊</span>
between<br />
  • what we are asking <i>about</i> (being as the <i>Gefragtes</i>) and<br />
  • the <i>very asking</i> as a mode of our own way of being ex-sistence as the <i>Fragen</i>.<br />
This unique reciprocity of ex-sistence and being is intimately bound up with what accounts for the
intelligibility of being.<span title="Heidegger ends by returning to the three specific
moments of his fundamental question:
• das Befragte: what we start with: our ex-sistence as the understanding of being
• das Gefragte: what we focus on: the being that we understand
• das Erfragte: what the goal is: what accounts for the intelligibility of being.">◊</span>

<b><i>The topics of the next two sections.</i></b> We have now demonstrated that a specific entity—ourselves as
ex-sistence—has <i>priority</i> with regard to being and is pre-given
<span title="Here again, as in SZ 7a, this is basically a simplification, even if it is correct. Exsistence
is not something from which we could abstract [the notion of] being; rather, ex-sistence is the
place where being is understood.">☞</span> 
as the subject matter to be questioned. In
what follows we will first demonstrate, first, ex-sistence’s <i>ontological</i> priority [= § 3] and then exsistence’s
<i>ontic</i> priority [= § 4]. In the latter case we will show why ex-sistence is <i>necessarily</i> the ontic
<i>Befragtes</i>, the subject matter to be questioned.
