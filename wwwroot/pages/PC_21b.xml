<b>2. <i>Being, as universal, is allegedly empty and need not be questioned.</i></b> The question has been trivialized and
declared superfluous ever since the Greeks—and precisely because of their accomplishments. People say that
“being” is the most <i>universal</i> and <i>empty</i> concept and, because we already understand it, need not and in fact
cannot be defined. The Greeks found the question obscure and disturbing, but nowadays it has supposedly
become “clear” and “self-evident.” Even to raise the question of “What accounts for the intelligibility of
being?”
<span style="color:magenta;" title="Heidegger articulates the question about the “Sinn von
Sein” as the question regarding (1) “worin gründet die innere Möglichkeit und Notwendigkeit der
Offenbarkeit des Seins” (GA 16: 66.15–6), i.e., “what accounts for the intrinsic possibility and necessity of
the openness [= the intelligibility] of being”; and about (2) “das von woher und wodurch . . . das Sein west”
(GA 73, 1: 82.15f.), i.e., about “whence and whereby being becomes meaningfully present.”">◊</span>
is considered to be an error of method.
