<b>2. <i>Being, as universal, is allegedly empty and need not be questioned.</i></b> The question has been trivialized and
declared superfluous ever since the Greeks—and precisely because of their accomplishments. People say that
“being” is the most <i>universal</i> and <i>empty</i> concept and, because we already understand it, need not and in fact
cannot be defined. The Greeks found the question obscure and disturbing, but nowadays it has supposedly
become “clear” and “self-evident.” Even to raise the question of “What accounts for the intelligibility of
being?” is considered to be an error of method.
