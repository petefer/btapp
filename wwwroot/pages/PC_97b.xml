<b>5. <i>The being of tools as their “referredness” to a task.</i></b>
Strictly speaking there never is “a” tool or implement off by
itself: it always is found in connection with other tools. A set of tools is “in order to…,” it’s for “<i>doing</i> something.”
As a means to an end, it can serve to… (= serviceability), can be used for (= utility), and so on. The “is for” or “in
order to”—the tool’s serviceability or utility—is the the way the tool is meaningfully present. The being of a tool is
the tool’s <i>referredness</i> (as the means) to a certain task (the end to be achieved). We now seek to show the “ontological
genesis” of this phenomenon, i.e., how a tool’s being (its meaningful presence) comes about.
