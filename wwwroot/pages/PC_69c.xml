<b>8. <i>Normal everydayness is usually overlooked.</i></b> “Everydayness” is personally closest to us (though we usually
overlook it) but ex-sistentially farthest from us. Traditional philosophy—and we ourselves—usually ignore and know
the least about. As St. Augustine puts it:<br /><br />
Quid autem propinquius meipso mihi? . . . Ego certe laboro hic et laboro in meipsum. Factus
sum mihi terra difficultatis et sudoris nimii.<br /><br />
What is closer to me than my own self? . . . [Nonetheless] I certainly am working hard here,
working on myself. My own self has become a field of hard labor and much sweat.<sup>1</sup><br />
<br />
Everyday life is opaque not only in our personal, non-philosophical lives but also and even more so in a philosophical-ontological
study of ex-sistence. In what follows we will do our best not to overlook this way of being that is closest
to us and to bring out its essential traits.
