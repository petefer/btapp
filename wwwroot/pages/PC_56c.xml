<b>17. <i>Function-2: showing something in speech.</i></b> In its fully concretized form, enacting a <i>logos</i> is a
matter of displaying something in <i>phonē</i>, vocalized sound, 
indeed in <i>phōnē meta phantasias</i>,<span style="color:magenta;" title="Heidegger unites phōnē from De anima II 8, 420b 29 with meta
phantasias from ibid., 420b 32. The word phantasia comes from phantazō: to make something
visible. Heidegger interprets phantasia as the ability of an animated (empsychos) entity to show
something, i.e., to make it understandable and understood. (Cf. “Φαντασία—daß sich etwas zeigt,”
GA 17: 15.18 = 11.5f.; Aristotle distinguishes between
1. psophos (Latin, sonus): either
1.1 the noise made by two solid objects hitting each other in the medium of air or
water (De anima II 8, 419b 4-25, 420a 3-420b 6); or
1.2 the inarticulate sound of an animal (agrammatos psophos, cf. Peri hermeneias 16a 29).
2. phōnē (Latin, vox): a vocalization, i.e., an articulate sound uttered by a human being as a
means to living well, to eu (De anima II 8, 420b 5—421a 6; phōnē here is synonymous with
dialektos and hermēneia in its secondary sense (ibid. 420b 18-20; cf. Editorial note to ¶ 35,
“hermeneutical,” below). Producing phōnē requires not only
2.1 respiration (anapnoē: ibid., 420b 15f., 26f.) and
2.2 throat, windpipe, lungs (pharungx?? artēria, pleumōn: ibid. 420b 23f., 29)
but also and above all
2.3 phantasia the ability to bring things to understanding, which goes with
2.4 the ability to sēmainein, to indicate matters to others.
Thus Aristotle defines a phōnē as a sound made by a living entity that brings something to
a meaningful understanding (ibid., II 8, 420b 29-32).">◊</span>
vocalized sound that makes something manifest in its meaning and thus understandable. In
speaking with another person, I let him or her “see” (i.e., understand) what I'm talking about,
regardless of whether I am right or wrong, honest or dishonest.
