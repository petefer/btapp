<b>17. <i>Discourse lets something be seen.</i></b> In its primary sense “discourse” (λόγoς as saying-something-about-something)
means “letting something be seen.” When it is fully concrete, discourse has the character of speaking or vocalizing in
words (φωνή), indeed φωνὴ μετὰ φαντασίας (<i>De anima</i> II 8, 420b32): a vocalization that lets something be seen.
