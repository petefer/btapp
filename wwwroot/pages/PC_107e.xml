<b>2. <i>An analysis of signs.</i></b>
We begin again with useful things, but now our goal is to understand the <i>referral-structure</i>
of such things. The referral of useful things can take a variety of forms, but we focus on the referral at work in a
particular kind of useful thing: <i>a sign</i>. There are different kinds of signs, but they have one characteristic in common:
they refer by <i>indicating</i> something. This will serve as our clue for understanding the structure of the things we meet
in the worlds of practical meaning.
