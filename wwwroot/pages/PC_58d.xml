<b>24. <i>The formal meaning of “phenomenology.”</i></b> In formal terms, “phenomenology” as the title of
a branch of philosophical work is composed, as we saw, of two words: <i>logos</i> and <i>phainomenon</i>
(plural: <i>phainomena</i>). In a general and formal sense, “phenomenology” means 
<i>legein ta phainomena</i>, making sense of what appears by drawing that sense from the thing itself rather than
from how we feel about the thing. In this formal sense, phenomenology embodies the maxim we
noted above: Stay directly focused on <i>what</i> you experience in terms of <i>how</i> you experience it.
