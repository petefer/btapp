<b>8. <i>Second, Christian theology.</i></b> Genesis offers a theological determination of human being: “Let us make man
in our image and likeness.”<sup>6</sup>
<span title="Heidegger cites the text in both Greek and Latin:
• καὶ εἶπεν ὁ θεός ποιήσωμεν ἄνθρωπον κατ' εἰκόνα ἡμετέραν καὶ καθ' ὁμοίωσιν
• faciamus hominem ad imaginem nostram et similitudinem.
GA 2: 65.24 adds an extra “nostram” after “similitudinem.” Pace both SZ and GA 2, the Latin Vulgate for
Genesis 1:26 reads: faciamus hominem ad imaginem et similitudinem nostram.">◊</span>
 Christianity combines this notion with the Greek one to come up to come up with
its idea of “man,” whose being as ens finitum, like that of God [as ens infinitum], is interpreted with the Greek
idea of being.<br />
Human self-transcendence. Modernity stripped away the Christian-theological elements from its
definition of man; nonetheless, its notion of “self-transcendence”—human being as reaching beyond intellect
and beyond itself—is still rooted in Christian dogma, which failed to problematize the being of man. For
example, Calvin:<br />
The first condition of man excelled in these extraordinary gifts, such that reason, intelligence, prudence,
and judgment, not only sufficed for the direction of life on earth, but also by means of them he transcended
all the way to God and to eternal happiness. <sup>7</sup> <span title="foJohn Calvin (1509-1564), @ Institutio [@Indez zu SZ] Heidegger cites the text in Latin:
His praeclaris dotibus excelluit prima hominis conditio, ut ratio, intelligentia, prudentia, judicium non
modo ad terrenae vitae gubernationem suppeterent, sed quibus transcenderet usque ad Deum et
aeternam felicitatem.
The ET is from Institutes of the Christian Religion, ed. John T. McNeill, trans. Ford Lewis Battles (Philadelphia:
Westminster Press, 1960), Book One: The Knowledge of God and the Creator, Chapter XV: Discussion of
Human Nature as Created, of the Faculties of the Soul, of the Image of God, of Free Will, and of the Original
Integrity of Man's Nature, Section 8: “Free choice and Adam’s responsibility,” p. 195.obar">◊</span><br />
And Zwingli:<br />
By the fact that he lifts his gaze towards God and his Word, man clearly shows that in his nature he is
innately very close to God, is like unto God and has a relation to Him—which unquestionably flows from
the fact that he was created in the image of God. <sup>8</sup> <span title="Huldrych Zwingli, (1484-1531), “On the Clarity and Certainty of the Word of God” [September
6, 1522]. Heidegger cites the text from Huldreich Zwinglis Werke. 1. Band: Deutsche Schriften: 1. Th., Lehrund
Schutzschriften zum Behufe des Ueberschrittes in die evangelische Wahrheit und Freyheit von 1522 bis
März 1524 (Zürich : Schultheß, 1830):
Deen daß der mensch sin ufsehen hat uf Gott und sin wort, zeigt er klarlich an, daß er nach siner natur
etwas Gott näher anerborn, etwas mee nachschlägt, etwas zuzugs zu jm hat, das alles on zwyfel darus
flüßt, daß er nach der bildnus Gottes geschaffen ist,”
GA 2: 66, together with note a, corrects some of Heidegger’s transcription as well as the source citation:
Deutsche Schriften I, 58. For the original [?] of Zwingli’s text cf. http://www.irg.uzh.ch/static/zwingliwerke/
