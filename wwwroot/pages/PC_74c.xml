<b>8. <i>Second, Christian theology.</i></b> Genesis offers a theological determination of human being: “Let us make man
in our image and likeness.”<sup>6 *</sup> Christianity combines this notion with the Greek one to come up to come up with
its idea of “man,” whose being as ens finitum, like that of God [as ens infinitum], is interpreted with the Greek
idea of being.<br />
Human self-transcendence. Modernity stripped away the Christian-theological elements from its
definition of man; nonetheless, its notion of “self-transcendence”—human being as reaching beyond intellect
and beyond itself—is still rooted in Christian dogma, which failed to problematize the being of man. For
example, Calvin:<br />
The first condition of man excelled in these extraordinary gifts, such that reason, intelligence, prudence,
and judgment, not only sufficed for the direction of life on earth, but also by means of them he transcended
all the way to God and to eternal happiness. <sup>7 *</sup><br />
And Zwingli:<br />
By the fact that he lifts his gaze towards God and his Word, man clearly shows that in his nature he is
innately very close to God, is like unto God and has a relation to Him—which unquestionably flows from
the fact that he was created in the image of God. <sup>8 *</sup>
