<b>14. <i>Heidegger’s claim: usefulness is prior. Transition to § 16.</i></b>
No, usefulness is experienced more immediately than
objective presence and as prior to it. Nonetheless, that of itself doesn’t resolve the question of the world of meaning
as such—in fact it <i>presupposes</i> the world of meaning. Usefulness pertains to <i>things</i>; and you can’t get the world of
meaning by adding up such things. We need a way to get <i>from</i> usefulness as the being of tools <i>to</i> the world of
meaning.<sup>40</sup>

<sup>40</sup> I might mention that the analysis of the lived world of meaning and generally the “hermeneutics of facticity” of
ex-sistence has been a topic in my courses since the winter semester of 1919-20.
