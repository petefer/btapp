<b>3. <i>Tools that are damaged.</i></b>
Things show up as meaningful within my various concerns, but sometimes I find that a
tool is damaged and unusable—say, a hammer. It’s still a hammer, but unfortunately I can’t use it. I discover that not
by detached observation of the tool’s properties but by practical foresight into what I want to use it for.

When I find that the hammer is damaged, it “stands out” as something that <i>should</i> be usable but isn’t. It doesn’t
completely lose its tool-character and become just objectively present, but nonetheless objective presence begins to
show through the hammer—only to withdraw again once I start to repair it. In any case, the damage did not consist in
a change of objectively present properties in the hammer.
