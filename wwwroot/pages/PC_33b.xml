<b>5. <i>Deciding one’s own ex-sistence.</i></b> I always understand myself in terms of ex-sistence, my
<i>ability to become myself</i> (or to fail to become myself). I’ve either stumbled into ways of becoming myself, or I’ve
grown up with them, or I’ve chosen them. We each must decide whether to take over our ex-sistence and
<i>become</i> it or, to neglect it. The question of ex-sistence is clarified only by personally ex-sisting.<br />
<b><i>The terms “ex-sistentiel” and “ex-sistential.”</i></b> I will use two adjectives regarding human being:<br />
  • “ex-sistenti<i>el</i>” refers to the <i>specific personal</i> elements of my ex-sisting.<br />
  • “ex-sistenti<i>al</i>” refers to the <i>common structural</i> elements of ex-sistence that all persons have; and
“ex-sistentiality” refers to the ensemble of all such structures.<br />
Ex-sisting ex-sistenti<i>elly</i>-personally does not require any theoretical understanding of the ex-sistenti<i>al</i>-<i>structural</i> elements of ex-sistence.
<br/>
Our analysis aims at the <i>structures that constitute</i> ex-sistence

is thus is an ex-sistenti<i>al</i> analysis.<sup>15</sup> But
its possibility and necessity is already indicated by [and will be discovered through]
the ex-sistenti<i>el</i>–personal elements of ex-sistence.
