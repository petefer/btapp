<b>11. <i>Worlds of meaning are usually hidden.</i></b>
It’s clear that a world of practical meaning is not the sum total of the tools
within it—if only because when such a world lights up, those things <i>lose</i> their meaningful status as tools and show up
as objectively present. I understand what a tool is “in itself” by actually <i>using</i> it. In that case, the referential structure
remains implicit, in the background. (That’s even more the case when I thematically <i>study</i> the tool from an objectivetheoretical
viewpoint.) Moreover, the referential structure <i>must</i> remain “hidden,” i.e., in the background, if the tool is
not to “stand out” as in ¶¶ 3-5 above. Such hiddenness is constitutive of the being-structure of tools.
