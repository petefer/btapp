2. These two tasks mandate two parts to the treatise:<br />
  <b>SZ I</b> analyzes ex-sistence in terms of temporality [SZ I.1-2] and explains time as the transcendental horizon
for the question of what accounts for being.<br />
  <b>SZ II</b> provides basic features of a phenomenological destruction of the history of ontology, using time as
our clue.<br />
<br/>
<b>SZ I has three divisions:</b><br />
Division 1 [SZ I.1] A preliminary and preparatory analysis of ex-sistence<br />
Division 2 [SZ I.2] Ex-sistence and temporality<br />
Division 3 [SZ I.3] Time and being<sup>¶</sup>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>SZ II has three divisions:</b><br />
Division 1 [SZ II.1] Kant’s doctrine of schematism and time: A preliminary stage in the problematic
of ur-temporality.”<br />
Division 2 [SZ II.2] The ontological basis of Descartes’ <i>ego cogito</i>: How the <i>res cogitans</i> appropriates
medieval ontology.<br />
Division 3 [SZ II.3] Aristotle and time: Discerning the phenomenal basis and limits of ancient ontology.

¶ <b>2, Time and Being</b>. [Ed. Heidegger lists four steps in the progression of SZ I.3:]<br />
• The difference [between the clearing and things] that goes with transcendence<br />
• Overcoming the horizon as such<br />
• Turning around into the source [of being]<br />
• Presence from out of this source
