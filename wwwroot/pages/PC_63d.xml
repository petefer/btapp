2. These two tasks mandate two parts to the treatise:<br />
  <b>SZ I</b> analyzes ex-sistence in terms of temporality [SZ I.1-2] and explains time as the transcendental horizon
for the question of what accounts for being.<br />
  <b>SZ II</b> provides basic features of a phenomenological destruction of the history of ontology, using time as
our clue.<br />
<br/>
<b>SZ I has three divisions:</b><br />
Division 1 [SZ I.1] A preliminary and preparatory analysis of ex-sistence<br />
Division 2 [SZ I.2] Ex-sistence and temporality<br />
Division 3 [SZ I.3] Time and being
<span title="[Ed. Heidegger lists four steps in the progression of SZ I.3:]
• The difference that goes with transcendence *
• Overcoming the horizon as such
• Turning around into the source [of being]
• Presence from out of this source

<b>SZ II has three divisions:</b><br />
Division 1 [SZ II.1] Kant’s doctrine of schematism and time:
<span style="color:magenta;" title="Published in 1929 as Kant und das Problem der Metaphysik and in
1973 as GA 3, with additional material in the fifth edition, 1991.">◊</span>
A preliminary stage in the problematic of ur-temporality.”<br />
Division 2 [SZ II.2] The ontological basis of Descartes’ <i>ego cogito</i>: How the <i>res cogitans</i> appropriates
medieval ontology.<br />
Division 3 [SZ II.3] Aristotle and time: Discerning the phenomenal basis and limits of ancient ontology.
