<b>34. <i>We begin with ex-sistence because we alone understand being.</i></b> The phenomenon in the phenomenological sense is
being; but being is always the being of things; therefore, we must make things present in the right way if we are to show
their being. Things must indicate the proper way to access them, and in that regard, the ordinary conception of
phenomenon is relevant. The goal of our study concerns being, but that goal already prescribes our first task, the
starting point of our investigation: to understand ourselves as the only things that understand being.
