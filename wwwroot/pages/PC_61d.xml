<b>34. <i>We begin with ourselves because we alone understand significance.</i></b> As we have said, the
phenomenon in the phenomenological sense is <i>being</i>, i.e., how and as what something is <i>significant</i>. 
But this significance is always the significance of some <i>thing</i>. Therefore, as § 2 and §4
pointed out, we have to begin with the <i>right</i> thing and with the <i>proper access</i> to that thing. And in
fact, the goal of this study—the intelligibility of being as it is in itself—has already prescribed the
thing that we should start with, namely ourselves.
