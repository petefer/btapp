<b>9. <i>Absorption in things is founded on engagement with meaning.</i></b> We are usually absorbed in some thing or
things, and such absorption is an ex-sistential. It is rooted in our engagement with meaning; and it is in terms
of <i>that fundamental engagement</i> that we will be articulating the various concepts of being. However, we cannot
understand this structure by using the traditional categories of being. We will approach the topic by contrasting
our <i>ex-sistential</i> structure with <i>categorial</i> notions of being, even if that entails stating the obvious. The being of
“the obvious” often escapes us, and it’s not clear that we have the adequate concepts for the task.
