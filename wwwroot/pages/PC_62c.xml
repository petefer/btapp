<b>37. <i>Phenomenological ontology begins and ends with ex-sistence.</i></b> Ontology and phenomenology are not two different
disciplines within philosophy. Rather, they characterize, respectively, the <i>subject matter</i> and the <i>procedure</i> of ontology.
Philosophy is universal phenomenological ontology, starting from the hermeneutics of ex-sistence. The following
analysis of ex-sistence<sup>¶</sup> fastens the Ariadne’s thread of philosophical questioning at the point <i>from which it arises</i> and
<i>to which it returns</i>.<sup>1</sup>

<sup>1</sup> Any progress this book makes in opening up “the things themselves” is thanks to Edmund Husserl’s personal
guidance during my apprenticeship in Freiburg, including his generous sharing of unpublished manuscripts on
various areas of phenomenology.<br />
¶ <b>37, The following analysis of ex-sistence</b>: “Ex-sistence” in a fundamental ontological sense, i.e., as related to the
disclosedness of the clearing itself, and only in that sense!
