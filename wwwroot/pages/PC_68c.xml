<b>6. <i>Summary, and the question of approach.</i></b>
These two fundamental traits,<br />
1. that my “essence” is <i>ex-sistence</i><br />
2. that my ex-sistence is always <i>mine to become</i><br />
show ex-sistence to be a unique phenomenon. We are never just objectively present in the universe; we do not just
“exist out there” as a thing among other things.<br />
But the question of how to approach ex-sistence is less clear and has to be worked out from within the present
analysis. How, then, how are we to properly present ex-sistence?
