<b>5. <i>Dilthey: life and lived experience.</i></b> Wilhelm Dilthey started with “life as a whole” and tried to understand
one’s lived experiences and their interconnections. His humanistic psychology does not focus on “mental”
elements, nor did it “piece together” the soul. Rather, it aims at the <i>whole</i> of life and its <i>forms</i> [<i>Gestalten</i>]. But
Dilthey’s real achievement was that he was on the way to the question of “life.” Nonetheless, his formulation
of the problem and his concepts were as limited as are those of Bergson, personalism, and philosophical
anthropology.

Husserl and Scheler: Their phenomenology of personhood is clearer and more radical; and although their
inquiries and worldviews differ, Husserl1 * @ and Scheler agree on what they are against, that is, they do not
ask about the being of the person. We focus on Scheler * (1) because his work is published2 and (2) because
he focuses on the being of a person’s acts as contrasted with anything “mental” [so-called “things in the mind”].
For Scheler a person is not a thing or substance, something “behind” or “outside” lived experiences. Rather, a
person is nothing other than the <i>unity</i> of its lived experiences as <i>immediately</i> lived.<sup>3</sup> Moreover, the person cannot
be reduced to the subject of normative rational acts.
