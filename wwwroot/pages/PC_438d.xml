<b>¶ 12 A new question: the connectedness of an individual life</b>
<br/>
<i>A. Brief résumé</i><br/>
1. Authentic historicity is:<br/> 
living my history in resolute anticipation.<br/> 
2. My acts of freeing-up and retrieving (rooted as they are in my aheadness) show that living my history authentically (i.e., authentic historicity) is weighted towards <i>Gewesenheit</i>.<sup>26</sup><br/> 
<i>B. Problems remain about the continuity of an individual’s life</i><br/>
3. But how does living one’s history authentically (= <i>Schicksal</i>) constitute the continuity of a person’s life from birth to death?<br/>
4. Can resolve shed any light on this? <br/>
5. Isn’t resolve only one experience within a continuous life?<br/>
6. Or is authentic living a continuous sequence of resolves?<br/>
7. Why do we have no satisfying answer to the question:<br/>
“What constitutes the connectedness of a life?”<br/>
8. Perhaps because we have focused too much on the <i>answer</i> without first testing whether the <i>question</i> is legitimate.<br/> 
<i>C. Problems of method in this regard</i><br/>
9. We must not fall back on the ordinary understanding of <i>Sein</i>.<br/> 
10. Rather, we must determine the source and ontological horizon of the seemingly obvious question:<br/> 
“What constitutes the connectedness of a life?”<br/>
