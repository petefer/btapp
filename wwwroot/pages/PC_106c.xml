<b>13. <i>Meaning is always already operative.</i></b>
If a world of meaning can light up, it must have been already opened up
(dis-closed) beforehand—and in fact, that is always already the case whenever my practical foresight is dealing with
a tool. Hence, I am always already “within” the world of meaning; and when I explicitly <i>turn</i> to it, I’m doing nothing
more than <i>returning</i> to it.
