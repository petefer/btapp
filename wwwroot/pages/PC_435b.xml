<b>¶ 3 Thrownness. The crowd’s self-understanding. Resolve</b>
<br/>
<i>A. The everyday</i><br/>
1. I am delivered over to [= thrown into] myself as possibility, as being-in-the-world.<br/>
2. I am thrown into a specific “world” with others.<br/>
3. Mostly I am lost in the crowd (das Man).<br/>
4. Mostly I understand myself in the public and “average” ways of the crowd.<br/>
5. And even though ambiguity has clouded these possibilities, I am quite familiar with them.<br/>
<i>B. Resolve and the everyday</i><br/>
6. Authentic self-understanding is never completely free from the crowd’s understandings of the self.<br/>
Rather, resolve chooses in terms of that understanding, for it or against it.
