<b>4. <i>The Greeks failed to clarify the being of the useful.</i></b>
The Greeks called practical things <i>pragmanta</i> (πράγματα),
i.e., the objects we’re involved with in our practical dealings or praxis (πρᾶξις)—but they did not clarify the 
<i>practical being</i> of such things but instead just thought of them as “mere things.”
<span style="color:magenta;" title="But why? εἶδος — μορϕή — ὕλη! but from τέχνη, hence
an interpretation in term of “production”! when μορϕή is not taken as εἶδος, ἰδέα! [German: Warum? εἶδος — μορϕή
— ὕλη! doch von τέχνη, also “künstlerische” Auslegung! wenn μορϕή nicht als εἶδος, ἰδέα!] [See Editor’s note,
below.]">☞</span>
We will call such objects either “the useful”
or “tools” or “implements” (e.g., for writing, sewing, transporting, etc.). To get at the <i>being</i> of the useful, we begin
with their <i>usefulness</i>, i.e., their status as tools.
