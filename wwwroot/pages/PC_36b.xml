<b>2. <i>We usually misunderstand our ex-sistence.</i></b> Although ex-sistence is ontically-ontologically prior, it is neither
given as such primarily nor can we grasp its being “immediately.” Yes, ex-sistence is the closest to us of everything
that is: we <i>are</i> it, each of us. But that’s precisely why ex-sistence is ontologically farthest from us. And yes, exsistence
does entail understanding our own being (and maintaining an interpretation of it). But we can’t take this
pre-theoretical understanding as an adequate clue to what our being properly is. The reason: because we tend to
understand ourselves in terms of the world of <i>things</i>.<sup>17</sup> It’s as if we let the world’s way of being “reflect back” onto
us.<sup>n</sup>
