<b>6. <i>Third: “Being is self-evident”—but what accounts for it?</i></b> We use and understand “is” or “being” in all
our relations, even in our relations to ourselves; hence, if being self-evident and always already understood,
it seems we needn’t raise questions about it. However, this everyday intelligibility reveals a puzzling fact: a
priori we <i>do</i> understand being, but we do not understand what makes it intelligible. Therefore we need to
ask <i>anew</i> “What accounts for the fact that we can and do understand being?”
