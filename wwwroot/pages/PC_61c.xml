<b>33. <i>Definitions of “phenomenal” and “phenomenological.”</i></b> On the basis of this preliminary conception of phenomenology,
we may define two terms:<br />
 • “phenomenal” refers to how and as what something shows up in direct, first-person
experience. In speaking of “phenomenal structures,” we are referring to the structures
of what we directly experience, i.e., how and as what we experience the thing and its
being—in a word, how the thing is significant.<span style="color:magenta;" title="In this text I paraphrase
“phenomenal” as “experiential.”">◊</span>
<br />
 • “phenomenological” refers to the way we do our <i>research</i> into phenomena. It refers to
second-order philosophical investigations, explanations, and conceptualizations of our
first-order experience.
