<b>33. <i>Defining “phenomenal” and “phenomenological.”</i></b> On the basis of this preliminary conception of phenomenology,
we may define two terms:<br />
 • “phenomenal” refers to the <i>structures of the phenomenon</i> that we encounter.<br />
 • “phenomenological” refers to the <i>method and conceptuality</i> employed in the effort.
