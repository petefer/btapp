<b>5. <i>Authenticity, inauthenticity.</i></b>
Ex-sistence is not only “mine” but also mine to become in this way or that. What is
more, I have <i>always already decided</i> (explicitly or implicitly) how I am becoming my own self. The reason: I
inevitably relate to my existence as possibility, i.e., as my can-and-must-become-myself. This is not a “property” I
have; it’s the way I <i>am</i> [and can choose to <i>enact</i>].<br />
It’s my choice: I can either choose myself or lose myself. But I can become inauthentic (i.e., lose myself)
only because I can become authentic (i.e., choose myself). My own self is mine to own.<br />
Personal authenticity and inauthenticity [i.e., becoming my own self or failing to do so] have their exsistential
basis in, and are made possible by, mineness, the fact that ex-sistence is mine-to-become. When I am
<i>in</i>authentic, I do not lose my mineness, nor have any less ex-sistence or a lower-grade of ex-sistence. I can be
inauthentic even in my most fulfilling moments: when I’m caught up in something, involved, interested, excited,
[studying philosophy]—whatever.
