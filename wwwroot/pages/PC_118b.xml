<b>6. <i>We already understand the unifying purpose of a world of suitabilities.</i></b>
Only because a world of suitabilities has
already been opened up beforehand can I discover a particular tool to be suitable for doing a job. Within that world I
already understand, even if only tacitly, the “worldly character” of the tool. I see how it functions within that set of
suitabilities, which in turn has an ontological relation to the world of meaning.
<br/>
Therefore, in freeing up the tool within an ensemble of means-to-ends suitabilities, I also disclose the 
<i>final purpose</i> of the tool. In ¶ 3 we said that the final purpose is what unites a chain of suitabilities. However, that final goal
cannot be a thing, not even a useful thing. Rather, it is ex-sistence.
<br/>
(N.B. If we reserve the proper sense of “discover” for the understanding of non-ex-sistential things, ex-sistence
can never be “discovered” as the final purpose.)
