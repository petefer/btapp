<b>12. <i>An objection and a response.</i></b>
Someone might argue that <i>before</i> I can take something as a sign, it must to be
already objectively present and understood. Well yes, it has to be “out there” so that I can encounter it. But the question
is <i>how</i> I encounter what’s “out there,” and no, I do not see it as just objectively present. I see it as something available,
something that can be used, even if I’m not yet clear on how to use it or what to do with it. The principle is this: 
<i>Even when I haven’t yet figured out what to do with it, whatever I encounter is never just “a thing out there.”</>
