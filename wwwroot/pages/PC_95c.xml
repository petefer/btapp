<b>2. <i>Method: start with practical life, the bracket out theoretical attitudes.</i></b>
Our <i>focal</i> topic is the <i>being</i> of things, that
is, their meaningful presence to us; but the <i>things</i> that have such meaningful presence are also our topic. We may call
them our “preliminary and accompanying topic.” We begin by looking at what we are concerned with in our practical
dealings—not the objects of theoretical knowledge but <i>useful</i> things: what we produce, make use of, and so on.
<br/>
Our practical know-how is phenomenological, i.e., it envisions the <i>being</i> of these things we use and produce.
We are not after the ontic characteristics of these things but the structure of their being so as to bring to light the
ontological understanding that is <i>already operative</i> in ex-sistence and that “comes to life” in our practical use of these
things.
<br/>
We don’t have to “put ourselves into” a practical frame of mind—because we are already there, constantly
using means to achieve ends: to open the door, you turn the doorknob. To experience things as <i>dealt with</i> (rather than
merely “observing” them), we merely have to out of play the theoretical attitudes and habits that crowd in on our
practical concerns with things. Those theoretical attitudes come to light when we ask: What things should we start
with?
