<b>7. <i>Purpose: to overcome ontic and ontological naīveté and obscurity.</i></b> Distinguish four kinds of science
and what each of them treats:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;• the ontic-positive sciences: things within specific, delimited areas<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;• regional ontologies: the being of specific areas of things, e.g., the being of history, nature, etc.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;• ontology in the broadest sense: the being of any and all things<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;• fundamental ontology:<sup>n</sup> <i>what accounts for the intelligibility</i> of being at all.<br />
Absent fundamental ontology, all ontology remains naïve and blind, even ontology in the broad sense,
which works out a non-deductive derivation of the possible kinds and ways of being.
