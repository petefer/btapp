<b>2. <i>Guided by the issues themselves.</i></b> By “ontology” we do not mean a specific philosophical
discipline that can be lined up with other disciples like epistemology, ethics, and so forth. This

(die Sachen selbst,” cf. Husserl, Logische Untersuchungen II, 1, p. 6) 
are both what shows up in experience and how it shows up—in German,
both das Seiende and das Sein des Seienden.

which is what makes possible the experience of things in their being.">◊</span>
which is an axiom that applies to all sciences and disciplines.
