<b>1. Plato, <i>Sophist</i> 244a6-8.</b> [In a dialogue with the young mathematician Theaetetus, the Eleatic Stranger
expresses puzzlement:]<br/>
“It is clear that these matters [namely, what you mean in saying ‘is’ or ‘has being’] have long been
known to you. We used to think we understood, but now we have become confused.”<span style="color:magenta;" title="is / has being: The Eleatic Stranger uses ὄν (without the definite article), the present participle of the
verb εἰμί (“I am”; infinitive εἶναι: “to be”). This ὄν points to the “is-ing” (the being) of something that “is-in-
being,” i.e., that “has being.”">☞</span>
