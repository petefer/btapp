<span title="[re Sophist 244a6-8]: Heidegger cites the text in Greek from Sophist 244a6-8 with the words in square
brackets taken from 244a5-6:
. . . δῆλον γὰρ ὡς ὑμεῖς μὲν ταῦτα [τί ποτε βούλεσθε σημαίνειν ὁπόταν ὂν φθέγγησθε] πάλαι
γιγνώσκετε, ἡμεῖς δὲ πρὸ τοῦ μὲν ᾠόμεθα, νῦν δ' ἠπορήκαμεν. . . .">◊</span><br/>
“It is clear that these matters [namely, what you mean in saying ‘is’ or ‘has being’] have long been
known to you. We used to think we understood, but now we have become confused.”<span title="is / has being: The Eleatic Stranger uses ὄν (without the definite article), the present participle of the
verb εἰμί (“I am”; infinitive εἶναι: “to be”). This ὄν points to the “is-ing” (the being) of something that “is-in-
being,” i.e., that “has being.”">☞</span>
