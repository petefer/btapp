“It is clear that these matters [namely, what you mean in saying ‘is’ or ‘has being’] have long been
known to you. We used to think we understood, but now we have become confused.”<sup>¶</sup>
<br/>
>¶ 1, <b>is / has being</b>: The Eleatic Stranger uses ὄν (without the definite article), the present participle of the
verb εἰμί (“I am”; infinitive εἶναι: “to be”). This ὄν points to the “is-ing” (the being) of something that “isin-
being,” i.e., that “has being.”
