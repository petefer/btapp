<b>8. <i>Our question aims at the a priori conditions of all science and all ontology.</i></b> The question regarding the
intelligibility of being aims at the <i>a priori</i> conditions (1) not only of the ontic-positive sciences that
investigate things of such-and-such a region and thus operate with an implicit understanding of being (2)
but also of ontology itself [whether regional or broad].
<i>All ontology remains blind until it carries out the fundamental task of clarifying how being is intelligible.</i>
