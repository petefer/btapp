<b>14. <i>Philosophy has focused on things rather than on the world of meaning.</i></b> The philosophical tradition has
overlooked our engagement with meaning and, with that, the world of meaning. Instead, it has focused on objectively
present things <i>within</i> the world of meaning (which in fact are not what we first encounter in the world), where those
things are interpreted in terms of “nature”.
<span style="color:magenta;" title="Here “nature” is taken in a Kantian sense, the sense of modern physics.
[Ed. GA 2: 88.17 adds the words “in diesem Sinne” (“in this sense”) to clarify that “Natur” is meant in a
Kantian/modern scientific sense. See Editor’s note, below.]">☞</span>
 In terms of the being of what we actually encounter, “nature” in this sense
is a “limit case.” It “de-worlds” the world of meaning [<i>Entweltlichung</i>]. We can never explain the world of meaning
by way of “nature” in the modern scientific sense.
<span style="color:magenta;" title="In fact it’s the
other way around.">☞</span>
Even “nature” as used in romanticism is understandable only in
terms of an analysis of ex-sistence.
