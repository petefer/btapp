<b>14. <i>Philosophy has focused on things rather than on the world of meaning.</i></b> The philosophical tradition has
overlooked our engagement with meaning and, with that, the world of meaning. Instead, it has focused on objectively
present things <i>within</i> the world of meaning (which in fact are not what we first encounter in the world), where those
things are interpreted in terms of “nature”<sup>¶</sup> In terms of the being of what we actually encounter, “nature” in this sense
is a “limit case.” It “de-worlds” the world of meaning [<i>Entweltlichung</i>]. We can never explain the world of meaning
by way of “nature” in the modern scientific sense. <sup>¶</sup> Even “nature” as used in romanticism is understandable only in
terms of an analysis of ex-sistence.
