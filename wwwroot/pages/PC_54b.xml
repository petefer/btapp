<b>11. <i>An appearance can become a semblance.</i></b> The rash is indeed a genuine phenomenon insofar as it shows up as a
rash. But the rash [= the third sense of phenomenon in the chart above] can privatively become a “semblance” [the
second sense of phenomenon in the chart] if it announces <i>something other</i> than the disease that causes it. For example,
let us say someone blushes out of embarrassment. If we take the redness of his cheeks <i>not</i> as a manifestation of
embarrassment but rather as the symptom of a fever (and thus of an underlying disease), the red cheeks would be a
<i>semblance</i>.
