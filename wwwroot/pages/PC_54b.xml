<b>11. <i>An appearance-3 can become an appearance-2, a mere semblance.</i></b> A rash is indeed a genuine
phenomenon (appearance-1) insofar as it shows up <i>as</i> a rash. But as a symptom (appearance-3) a
rash can “privatively” become a mere semblance or specious appearance if it indicates 
<i>something other</i>
than what actually causes the rash, thereby <i>depriving</i> the symptom of its true meaning. Say,
for example, a young man blushes out of embarrassment. If we were to take the redness of his
cheeks <i>not</i> as a manifestation of embarrassment but as the symptom of an underlying fever, the
red cheeks in that case would be a <i>mere semblance</i>.
