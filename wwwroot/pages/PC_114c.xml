<b>1. <i>Review of §§ 15-17. The task of § 18.</i></b>
A review of the foregoing:
</p>
<p id="PC_114c">
• I meet tools within a world of praxis.
</p>
<p id="PC_114c">
• The being of tools is their usefulness, which has an ontological relation to that world and to its structure.
</p>
<p id="PC_114c">
• That world is always operative and in fact has already be disclosed, even if only unthematically.<sup>¶</sup>
</p>
<p id="PC_114c">
• The meaning-giving world can “light up” when tools are damaged, missing, or in the way.
</p>
<p id="PC_114c" class="noindent">
In the present section we will deal with the following questions:
</p>
<p id="PC_114c">
• How does the world of praxis let us encounter something as a tool?
</p>
<p id="PC_114c">
• What does it mean to say that tools get “freed up beforehand” for our concern and foresight?
</p>
<p id="PC_114c">
• How does the world of meaning affect the being of tools?
</p>
<p id="PC_114c">
• Most importantly: What is the essential structure of such worlds of meaning?
