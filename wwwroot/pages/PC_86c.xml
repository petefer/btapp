<b>1. <i>Summary of § 12. The problem of subject-object thinking.</i></b> Engagement with meaning is both (1) our
<i>ex-sistential structure</i> and (2) the <i>ex-sistentiel</i> way we each live our personal lives. Hence, since we do understand our own exsistence,
we must have <i>some</i> experience of it, even if only a vague familiarity.
<br/>
But traditionally (and even today) the engagement with meaning has been interpreted superficially and formally
as a subject-object relation. This is at best a half-truth. Subject and object do not map on to the relation of ex-sistence
and meaning.

Even placing the two pairs together [in the same sentence] in order to reject the equivalance is fatal.">☞</span>
