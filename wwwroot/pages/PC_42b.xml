<b>3. <i>From historicity [SZ I.2] to the history of ontology [SZ II].</i></b> We have established the ontic-ontological necessity of
the question “How is being intelligible?” In pursuing that question and the historicity of ex-istence, it becomes clear
that the question about being is itself characterized by historicity. The inquiry into being has its own history, which we
have to investigate and positively appropriate in its inner possibilities.

The progression of the book, therefore, is, first, to show that the being of ex-sistence is temporality and historicity
[= SZ I.1-2]; then to show that ur-temporality makes being intelligible [= SZ I.3]; and finally to work out certain
historical [<i>historisch</i>] elements of the question of being [= SZ II].
