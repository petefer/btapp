<b>14. <i>The objection.</i></b>
We have defined (1) the being of tools as means-to-end suitability and (2) the essence of the world
of praxis are a set of references. But someone might object: In doing so, you have dissolved the “substantial being of
things” into a system of relations; and since relations are “thoughts,” you have reduced the being of tools to “mere
thoughts.”
