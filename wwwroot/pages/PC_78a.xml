<b>1. <i>Summary of § 9.</i></b> First, my ex-sisting consists in relating to and understanding my ex-sisting: this is the formal
concept of Existenz. Second, ex-sistence is always mine—and mine to become: this is what makes authenticity
and inauthenticity possible. I always live as either authentic or inauthentic—or in a state of indifference.<sup>*</sup>
