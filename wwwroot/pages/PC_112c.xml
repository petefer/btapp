<b>13. <i>Signs as intentionally conspicuous—and as “standing out.”</i></b>
Whereas useful things mostly do not “stand out,”
signs by contrast are both useful <i>and</i> conspicuous—for example, the string I tie on my finger to remind me of an
appointment. What such signs indicate is something in our everyday lives, and that can include just about anything.
I’m the only one who knows what the string means, and yet I can forget that. In that case the string on my finger is
still a sign, but I forget what it’s supposed to remind me of. It “stands out” and bothers me—and I may need a <i>second</i>
sign to remind me what the first one was for.
