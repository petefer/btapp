<b>7. <i>How that unifying purpose gets understood.</i></b>
How is it that I already understand the final purpose?
</p>
<p id="PC_118c">
• Insofar as I ex-sist, I understand being.
</p>
<p id="PC_118c">
• In understanding being, I understand my own ex-sistence as engaged with the world of meaning.
</p>
<p id="PC_118c">
• In opening up beforehand a world of praxis to which I am always already related, and in thus freeing up
things to be suitable within that world, I also understand the final purpose to which they are directed.
