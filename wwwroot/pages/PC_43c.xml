<b>6. <i>The devolution of traditional ontology.</i></b> Above, § 1 showed that the question “How is being intelligible?” has been
neglected, or badly formulated, or forgotten. Greek ontology still influences us today in such a way that when we
understand either ex-sistence or being, we do so in terms of <i>things</i>.

Greek ontology has devolved into a “self-evident tradition” that might get “reworked” as it was in Hegel. The
Middle Ages took over this uprooted Greek ontology dogmatically and as a whole. Scholasticism (by way of some
admittedly significant work) then turned it into a fixed, systematic doctrine that led through Suarez’s
<i>Disputationes metaphysicae</i> [1597] to the transcendental philosophy of modernity, which influenced even Hegel’s “logic.”<sup>¶</sup>

Moreover, as the question of being got neglected, particular regions of being assumed the role of guiding issues—
cf. Descartes’s <i>ego cogito</i>, the subject, the “I,” reason, spirit, person, etc.—without the structure of their being getting
clarified. The result is that either unquestioned ontological categories dominate these topics without being questioned,
or dialectics gets enlisted to provide an ontological interpretation of the substantiality of the subject.
