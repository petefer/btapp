<b>¶ 5 Schicksal in relation to “the blows of fate”</b>
<br/>
1. I can be buffeted existentielly by the “blows of fate” only because I am, existentially, Schicksal.<br/>
2. Resolute, freed for myself, and living my Schicksal, I see that as in-the-world I am open to both the beneficial and the harmful.<br/>
3. But such events do not bring about Schicksal.<br/>
4. Both the resolute and the irresolute are buffeted by such events, (the irresolute even more than the resolute), but the irresolute can “have” no Schicksal.<br/>
