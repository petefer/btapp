<b>11. <i>The limitations of these sciences.</i></b> We are not passing judgment on the positive achievements of
anthropology, psychology, and biology. We are merely suggesting that they cannot answer the question about
the <i>being</i> of human beings. We cannot get to the ontological foundations of ex-sistence by way of hypotheses
derived from empirical material, because even if one does that, presuppositions about the <i>being</i> of human beings
are <i>already</i> operative <i>before</i> we collect the empirical material, despite the fact that positive-scientific research
overlooks them.<sup>9</sup>
