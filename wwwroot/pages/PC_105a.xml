<b>9. <i>The tool’s referral structure—and thus the current world of meaning—lights up.</i></b>
The being of a tool—what it
“is in itself”—consists in its referral to a task. That referral-structure is operative when I use the tool (and encounter
other things that are not usable), but it’s operative <i>tacitly</i>. However, when the referral-structure gets disrupted (= when
the tool is damaged and unusable), that structure becomes <i>visible</i>.

I may not understand it explicitly as the “being structure of the tool,” but my practical foresight notices it: I see
what the unusable tool <i>was for</i> and, together with that, I also see the whole context of the task I was working on.
Previously I understood that context only implicitly, but now it “lights up.” I see it as what my foresight had
presupposed all along. My current world of meaning suddenly comes into view.
