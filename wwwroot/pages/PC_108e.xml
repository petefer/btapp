<b>5. <i>What we exclude from this analysis</i></b>
We want to analyze signs as distinct from referrals, but we cannot discuss the
full panoply of signs. (For the kinds of signs that are not analyzed in this section, see Chart 1, above. Each of those
can be easily formalized so as to “fit” under the rubric of “a relation,” but that offers absolutely no help in the matter.)
