<b>12. <i>Caring about things: its ordinary and its ex-sistential meanings.</i></b> Facticity—our thrownness into worlds of
meaning—entails that our engagement with meaning is split into various forms (e.g., involvement with things,
producing, using, and losing things, etc.). When our engagement with meaning is thing-focused, we call it
“caring about things” [<i>Besorgen</i>].<sup>*</sup> (We leave a definition of its being for later.) There are also
privative@privative modes, in which our caring about things is barely operative—e.g., omitting things,
neglecting them, etc.

<p id="PC_83b" class="noindent">
The ordinary, pre-theoretical meaning of “caring about things” is: <i>dealing with them</i> (e.g., getting a job
done, acquiring something, even being apprehensive about things).
</p>
<p id="PC_83b" class="noindent">
By contrast, we define “caring about things” as an ex-sistential, a possible way that we make sense of things
in the practical and productive spheres. Eventually, in Chapter 6, § 41, we will define its ontologically as “being
concerned” (<i>Sorge</i>), taken in an ex-sistential sense. We take “being concerned” not in the sense of “the cares
and tribulations of life,” real as these are for us. Rather, it means that, as engaged with meaning, ex-sistence is
<i>ex-sistentially interested</i>, and only because of that can we be happy or sad, carefree or care-ridden, and generally
concerned about things. <sup>¶</sup>
