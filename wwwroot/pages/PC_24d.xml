<b>2. <i>The three elements of any theoretical question.</i></b> Questioning is a form of seeking, and seeking is guided
by what is being sought. Questioning is a seeking for <i>knowledge</i>, specifically for what, that, and how the
thing is. A scientific-theoretical question has three moments:<sup>n</sup><br />
  • <i>Befragtes</i>: the subject matter: the <i>thing</i> we are questioning.<br />
  • <i>Gefragtes</i>: the focus: what we are asking <i>about</i> that thing<br />
  • <i>Erfragtes</i>: the goal: what we are asking <i>for</i> regarding that thing<br />
Questions come from questioners, who have their own way of ex-sisting <i>as</i> questioners.<sup>n</sup> There are casual
questions and explicit questions. In explicit questions, all three factors of the question need to be clarified.
