<b>2. <i>The three elements of any theoretical question.</i></b> Questioning is a form of seeking, and seeking is guided
by what is being sought. Questioning is a seeking for knowledge, specifically for what, that, and how the
thing is. A scientific-theoretical question has three moments:<sup>n</sup><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;• Befragtes: the subject matter: the thing we are questioning.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;• Gefragtes: the focus: what we are asking about that thing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;• Erfragtes: the goal: what we are asking for regarding that thing<br />
Questions come from questioners, who have their own way of ex-sisting as questioners.<sup>n</sup> There are casual
questions and explicit questions. In explicit questions, all three factors of the question need to be clarified.
