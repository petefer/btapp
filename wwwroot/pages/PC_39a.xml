<b>9. <i>Time accounts for the intelligibility of being.</i></b> In § 4 we mentioned that ex-sistence’s ontic structure entails a pretheoretical
understanding of being. Our aim is to show that we always, if implicitly, understand being in terms of

To do this we first have to distinguish our understanding of time from the traditional notions of time stretching
from Aristotle to Bergson. We will show [cf. SZ I.2. chapter 6] that the traditional notion of time originates from exsistential
temporality—as against Bergson’s thesis that time in the traditional sense is actually space.
