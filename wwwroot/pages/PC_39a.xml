<b>9. <i>Time accounts for the intelligibility of being.</i></b> In § 4 we mentioned that ex-sistence’s ontic structure entails a pretheoretical
understanding of being. Our aim is to show that we always, if implicitly, understand being in terms of

or field for understanding and interpreting being.</i>

To do this we first have to distinguish our understanding of time from the traditional notions of time stretching
from Aristotle to Bergson. We will show [cf. SZ I.2. chapter 6] that the traditional notion of time originates from exsistential
temporality—as against Bergson’s thesis that time in the traditional sense is actually space.
