<b>6. <i>Scheler, continued.</i></b> Scheler agrees with Husserl:<sup>4</sup> a person is not a thing, a substance, or an object; and the
constitution of a person is different from that of things in nature. Scheler writes:<br/>
An act is never an object. The essence of the being of an act entails that it is
experienced only in its enactment and it is given in reflection.<sup>5</sup><br/>
Acts are not “in the mind.” A person is never an object but exists only as enacting intentional acts. To turn the
mind into an object and then to take acts as something “in the mind” is to de-personalize the person. A person
is always the enacter of intentional acts that are connected by the unity of their sense. The being of mind has
nothing to do with the being of a person. Acts are enacted, and persons are the enacters.<br/>
Nonethless, critical questions remain:<br/>
• What is the being of an enactment, in terms of which we could define the being of a person?<br/>
• If a person is a unity of body, soul, and spirit (each of which can be the subject of a different study),
and if each element has its own way of being, we cannot get to the being of a person by adding up the
being of each element.<br/>
• If we tried to do that, we would have to have a prior notion of the being of the whole—and what is
that?<br/>
Transition to Greek and Christian notions. The theory of human being in both Greek philosophy and
Christian theology is an obstacle to raising the question of ex-sistence; and both personalism and the philosophy
of life fail to see that those foundations are ontologically inadequate. There are two important elements in those
traditional theories of human being.
