<b>12. <i>Fundamental ontology is the analysis of ex-sistence.</i></b> In showing the ontic-ontological distinctiveness
of ex-sistence we have also shown the ontic-ontological distinctiveness of the question about being. But § 2
showed that there is a unique relation between ex-sistence and the question of what accounts for being, and
thereby intimated that in order to get clear on that question we first have to analyze ex-sistence in terms of
its way of being. <i>Such an analysis is what we call fundamental ontology</i>.
