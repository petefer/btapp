<b>9. <i>The entire complex is (1) implicitly familiar and (2_ the basis for any explicit ontology.</i></b>
In my everyday life I am
always already familiar with such worlds of praxis even if I do not understand them explicitly or theoretically. That
pre-theoretical familiarity constitutes my very ex-sistence and my understanding of being. It also is the basis of any
theoretical-ex-sistential ontology of human being. It is what we need to spell out explicitly in order to understand (1)
human being, (2) the being of things, and (3) what it is that makes being itself intelligible.
