<b>20. <i>λόγος as judgment is not the primary locus of ἀλήθεια.</i></b> It is wrong to invoke Aristotle as the source of this
position, because:<br />
 • αἴσθησις [sense perception] is more originally disclosive than is λόγος. Sense perception always aims at its
ἴδιον [its proper object]—that which is accessible only through <i>that particular</i> sense. (Sight discloses color,
hearing discloses sound). Thus αἴσθησις always and more originally lets its ἴδιον be perceived.<br />
 • νοεῖν [intellectual intuition] in its pure form is the direct perception of the simplest forms of being: it is
disclosive in the purest, most original sense. It only dis-covers and can <i>never cover up</i> its object. It can never
be false; at worst, it can be a non-perceiving (ἀγνοεῖν: cf. <i>Metaphysics</i> IX 10, 1052a2).<sup>n</sup>
