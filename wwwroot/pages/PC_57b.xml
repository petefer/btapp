<b>20. <i>Function-5: making a judgment.</i></b> By considering the original meaning of the noun <i>alētheia</i>
and the verb <i>alētheuein</i>, we can see that it is a gross misunderstanding to invoke Aristotle as the
source of the erroneous thesis that the primary locus of alētheia—the primary place where sense
is made of something—is the judgment underlying a declarative statement.<span style="color:magenta;" title="On Heidegger’s important distinctions regarding the kinds and levels of alētheia,
see the editorial note to § 44 ¶ 5, “the original experience of alētheia among the Greeks.”">◊</span>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Judgment as an act of synthesis is not the primary locus of <i>alētheia</i> as disclosure. On the
contrary, in comparison with <i>logos</i> as the <i>synthetic</i> apprehension of what something is and how it
operates, Aristotle holds to two forms of <i>non</i>-synthetic apprehension that are more fundamental.
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Sense perception (<i>aisthēsis</i>) discloses things more originally than does <i>logos</i>-qua-judgment,
insofar as
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • Every sense faculty aims directly and exclusively at its proper object (its <i>idiom</i>,
plural <i>idia</i>).<span style="color:magenta;" title="Commenting on De anima II 6, 418al1 and De anima III 3, 427b12, Heidegger says: “An
idion is something accessible through one specific manner of perceiving and only through that manner of perceiving. It has the character of being aei alēthes, i.e., always disclosive of its object.
GA 17: 8.15-17 = 5.24-26.">◊</span> 
The proper object of the eye is color, that of the ear is sound (the
eye does not hear sound, and the ear does not see color), and so on.
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • Moreover, that proper object of sense perception is immediately disclosed
through the correlative organ <i>without needing a mediating synthesis</i> to bring
together the sense faculty and its proper object.
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • Therefore, sense perception, as non-synthetic, is always disclosive (<i>alēthes</i>) of
its objects and can never be mistaken (pseudes). I either see color, or I don't see
at all.<span style="color:magenta;" title="Cf. Stephen Dedalus' musings on Aristotle and sight,
“Ineluctable modality of the visible”: James Joyce, Ulysses (Gabler ed.), 31.1.">◊</span>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Pure intellectual intuition (<i>noein/noēsis</i>) has its object directly and immediately
present-to-mind. It is the non-synthetic apprehension not of a <i>thing</i> but of the simplest
elements of what and how the thing <i>is</i>: the thing's <i>being</i>. As direct and non-synthetic,
intellectual intuition is likewise always <i>alēthes</i>/disclosive in the purest and most
original sense. It can never “cover something over,” it can never be incorrect. Either I
have the being of something present-to-mind (<i>noein</i>) 
or I do not know it at all (<i>agnoein</i>).<span style="color:magenta;" title="Metaphysics IX 10, 1052a2. Cf. GA 21:177.10-20 = 158.13-159.10.">◊</span>
