<b>14. <i>The Greeks and time: οὐσία as a thing’s being-present.</i></b> Although Descartes’ dependence on medieval
scholasticism and its terminology is well known, it is less clear how medieval philosophy determined (or not) the being
of the <i>res cogitans</i>. But we cannot resolve that issue until we show how ancient ontology dealt with the question of
being—and what it missed.
<br/>
Our destruction of ancient ontology will dismantle it in light of ur-temporality. We will show that the Greeks
interpreted being in terms of <i>things</i>—nature in the widest sense—<i>and</i> that time figured into this interpretation. Some
outward evidence: they understood being as παρουσία = οὐσία = the presentness [<i>Anwesenheit</i>] of things. That is, they
understood the being of things in terms of a definite moment of time: the present [<i>die Gegenwart</i>].
