<b>7. <i>The science of ontology arises from our pre-theoretical understanding of being.</i></b> Science is an activity
in which we relate to things that we need not be. But the ex-sistence that does science is unique: it is
necessarily in a world of meaning [<i>Sein in einer Welt</i>].
<span style="color:magenta;" title="The exact term “In-der-Welt-sein” first appears at SZ 41a, but Heidegger anticipates
the notion here.">◊</span>
Our [pre-theoretical] understanding of being
includes a threefold, interrelated understanding of<br />
  • our own ex-sistence—<i>as correlative to</i><br />
  • the world of meaning<br />
  • the being of things that we are not.<br />
The ontic structure of ex-sistence is necessarily ontological, i.e., it entails a pre-thematic understanding of
being; and all ontology is founded on and motivated by the ontic structure of ex-sistence.
