<b>3. <i>My “essence” consists in my Existenz.</i></b>
The basic attributes of ex-sistence are not mere “properties” or “aspects” of
objectively present things in space and time. Rather, they are <i>fundamental abilities, the basic ways we can ex-sist</i>—
that is, the ways we can <i>achieve our ex-sistence</i>—and nothing more. All forms of what-and-how-I-am are instances
of ex-sistence [<i>Existenz</i>, i.e., ontological self-relatedness]. Thus, the term “ex-sistence” [<i>“Dasein”</i>], which applies
only to human beings, does not refer to a “what” (as with things) but to our <i>being</i>, to <i>how we are</i>.
