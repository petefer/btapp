<b>15. <i>The clue to all this: ex-sistence as λόγος.</i></b> The clue for approaching Greek ontology has to be ex-sistence,
understood as ζῷον λόγον ἔχον, the living thing whose being is determined by the ability to speak. That is, λέγειν (cf. §
7 B) is the key to unlocking the being of whatever we speak about. Thus in Plato ontology becomes dia-lectic. But
Dialectic has become a philosophical embarrassment. A proper “hermeneutic” of λόγος will allow us a more radical
understanding of the problem of being.

The Marburg Neo-Kantians claim Aristotle lacked an understanding of Platonic dialectic—whereas in fact he
rendered it superfluous by raising the issue to a higher and more radical level. Aristotle took up where Parmenides left
off. Parmenides [fragment 3] had seen the necessary correlation of νοεῖν and εἶναι—minding and being. Aristotle went
further and saw νοεῖν as the direct awareness of what is present <i>in its presentness</i>, so that νοεῖν has the ur-temporal
structure of “making something meaningfully present.” Things that show up in and for νοεῖν as making-present are seen
as things in the most proper sense: they are understood in terms of the present, as <i>having presence</i> (οὐσία).
