<b>3. <i>Signs are a particular kind of referral.</i></b>
Taken in the most formal sense, a sign is one example of a relation. A sign
is a relation in which one thing <i>refers</i> to another; and its specific way of referring to something else is by <i>indicating</i>
it.

Note: We understand “relation” not by way of generalization, that is to say, not as a genus that subsumes different
species (e.g., signs, symbols, expressions, meanings) but rather in a very formal sense. Using the method of
“formalization” we can recognize “relation” as functioning in all kinds of connections, whatever their content or mode
of being.<sup>1</sup>
