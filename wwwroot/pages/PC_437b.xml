<b>¶ 7 <i>Schicksal</i> is grounded in care and temporality</b>
<br/>
<i>A. Care and temporality make Schicksal possible</i><br/>
1. <i>Schicksal</i>, as resolute living, is the powerless power of<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Rede</i>:] silently<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Verstehen</i>:] understanding oneself<sup>21</sup><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Befindlichkeit</i>:] as thrown (“guilty”) and ready-for-dread.<br/>
Hence, care and temporality are what make <i>Schicksal</i> possible.<br/>
2. Care includes thrownness, finitude, death, conscience, and freedom and thus makes me able to ex-sist as <i>Schicksal</i> i.e., it makes one existentially historical.<br/>
