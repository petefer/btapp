<span title="Note that Heidegger calls ontology the “inquiry into the intelligibility of things”
(“Fragen nach dem Sinn des Seienden,” SZ 12.14-15), thereby implicitly interpreting “Sein” as “Sinn.” This
reading has remained constant in all editions of SZ from 1927 through the thirteen edition in @ Only in GA

explanation, to the “Sein des Seienden.”">◊</span>
When we say that ex-sistence is
onto-logical [i.e., that we understanding being], we are referring not to the <i>science</i> of being but to our <i>pre</i>-scientific
[pre-ontological, pre-theoretical] <i>lived</i> understanding of being. “Pre-ontological” is not the same
as “ontic”—that is, our understanding is not confined to <i>things</i>—but instead indicates that our way of being
consists in understanding both our way of being and the being of everything else.
<span title="SZ 147c says that this thesis is
only dogmatically asserted here but proven in SZ § 31.">◊</span>
