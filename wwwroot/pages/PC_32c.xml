<b>3. <i>We have a “pre-ontological” understanding of our ex-sistence.</i></b> We will reserve the proper sense of the
term “ontology” for the theoretical science of the meaning of things. When we say that ex-sistence is
onto-logical [i.e., that we understanding being], we are referring not to the <i>science</i> of being but to our <i>pre</i>-scientific
[pre-ontological, pre-theoretical] <i>lived</i> understanding of being. “Pre-ontological” is not the same
as “ontic”—that is, our understanding is not confined to <i>things</i>—but instead indicates that our way of being
consists in understanding both our way of being and the being of everything else.
