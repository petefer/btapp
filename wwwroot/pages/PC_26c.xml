<b>9. <i>Turning the question of being back upon the questioner.</i></b> Given the above, we must<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;• explain how to view being<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;• clarify how to conceptualize its intelligibility<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;• choose the right thing to start with<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;• get the right access to that thing.<br />
But these four activities—explaining, clarifying, choosing, and getting access—are activities of a
<i>questioner</i>, that is, of <i>ourselves</i>. So first of all we must question the questioner: we have to 
<i>clarify ourselves in our own being</i>.<sup>8</sup>

Questioning is a way that we <i>are</i>: our being consists in (and is determined by) asking about the
being of things, including ourselves. I call this specific way of being “ex-sistence” [<i>Dasein</i>]. In order to
understand how being is intelligible, we must first explain our <i>own</i> being.<sup>9</sup>
