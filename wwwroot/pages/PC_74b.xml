<b>7. <i>First, Greek philosophy.</i></b> Here “man” is defined as zōion logon ekhon,* the animal that has logos. There are
two problems with this definition:<br />
• zōion, “animal,” is understood as a mere spatio-temporal thing;<br />
• logos is taken as a higher endowment.<br />
But there is a double obscurity here: (1) the being of this logos remains as equally unclarified as (2) its
combination with animality.
