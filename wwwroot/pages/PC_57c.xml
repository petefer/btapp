<b>21. <i>λόγος as judgment can be either true or false.</i></b> Unlike νοεῖν, λόγος <i>qua</i> showing something <i>as</i> something has a
synthesis structure, which allows for a covering-up. Opposed to that is a “true judgment” [ἀλήθεια-3], which itself has
<i>multiple foundations</i>.
<span style="color:magenta;" title="Later Heidegger will show those foundations to be alētheia-2 (meaningful presence) and
alētheia-1, ex-sistence as the clearing.">◊</span>
Realism and idealism both miss the Greek sense of ἀλήθεια, which alone is the source of any
“theory of ideas” as philosophical <i>knowledge</i>.
