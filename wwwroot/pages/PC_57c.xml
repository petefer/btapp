<b>21. <i>A <i>logos</i> as judgment can be either correct or incorrect.</i></b> In contrast to <i>noein</i>'s direct and
unmediated intellectual knowledge, <i>logos</i> as a judgment is synthetic and mediated knowledge of
something. It is able to make sense of something only as this or that, only by synthesizing some
kind of predicate with the subject, always with the possibility of getting it wrong. That makes for
two possibilities.
<br/>
• A judgment can be incorrect/false. Whether intentionally or not, the speaker can
synthesize the wrong predicate with what is under discussion, thereby “covering it
over.”
<br/>
• A judgment be correct/true. The speaker can synthesize the thing under discussion with
a correct predicate, thereby making a true judgment <i>alētheia</i>-3.
<br/>
Therefore, the synthetic truth of correct judgments is t certainly not the foundation of <i>alētheia</i>/disclosure 
as such. It is merely secondary and derivative insofar as it is based on the two forms of
<i>immediate</i> apprehension: <i>aisthēsis</i> and <i>noein</i>, sense perception and intellectual intuition.
<br/>
Both realism and idealism miss the Greek sense of <i>alētheia</i>. Only on the basis of that
original sense of disclosure can Plato's “doctrine of ideas” be understood as philosophical
<i>knowledge</i>.<span style="color:magenta;" title="Heidegger
