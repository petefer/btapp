<b>10. <i>A fourth meaning of phenomenon: “appearance”: in Kant.</i></b> The possible confusion continues because of a <i>fourth</i>
meaning of “appearance,” namely “<i>mere</i> appearances” in the <i>Critique of Pure Reason</i>. To explain that, let us take an
example.

Say I think of the symptom [e.g., a rash] as a genuine, self-showing phenomenon that <i>emanates</i> from the disease. In
turn, say I think of the disease as <i>never able</i> to directly show itself and thus become a genuine phenomenon. In this case
the symptom, as an <i>emanation</i> from the disease, is understood as something “brought forth” that “brings out” or
<i>presents</i> the disease without actually <i>being</i> the disease. The rash is a “mere appearance” in the sense that the rash is
“brought forth” by, and announces, the disease, but the disease remains hidden behind the rash. (However, we do not
call the rash a “semblance” inasmuch as it does not <i>cover over</i> a genuine phenomenon.)

Kant uses “appearance” (<i>Erscheinung</i>) in this twofold sense:<br />
 1. In one sense, empirical appearances <i>do</i> show themselves in sense intuition: in themselves they
are genuine phenomena.<br />
 2. But in another sense, such empirical appearances are the <i>emanation</i> of the noumenon, and the
noumenon itself <i>remains ever hidden behind</i> the empirical appearing-and-announcing.<br />
