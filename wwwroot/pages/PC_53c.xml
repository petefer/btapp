<b>10. <i>Phenomena as “mere appearances” in Kant.</i></b> The possible confusion increases due to a fourth
meaning of “appearance,” namely “mere appearances” in the <i>Critique of Pure Reason</i>. To explain
this fourth meaning, we will use an analogy to understand what Kant is getting at.
<br/>
Say I think of a symptom (e.g., a rash) as a genuine, self-showing phenomenon that
emanates from the disease. In turn, say I see that the disease will never be able to appear directly
and thus can never become a genuine phenomenon. In so doing, I see the rash
<br/>
• as brought forth by the disease, i.e., emanating from it, and
<br/>
• as pointing to the disease insofar as the disease manifests itself indirectly through
the rash. In this sense the rash is a “mere appearance” of the disease that remains
hidden “behind” the rash.
<br/>
• Note, however, that as mentioned at the end of ¶ 7, we do not call the rash a “mere
semblance”—an appearance-2—inasmuch as it does not hide or obscure a genuine
phenomenon.

• On the one hand, in Kant empirical appearances <i>do show themselves<//i> as the objects of
empirical intuition. In that regard, they are genuine phenomena in our sense of the term.

sense of “phenomenon” is not the same as Kant’s. In the “Aesthetic” Kant defined appearance as:

The empirical appearances (phenomena as mere <i>Erscheinungen<i> in Kant) are “mere appearances”
in Kant's sense of that term: they do not bring the noumena to self-manifestation.
