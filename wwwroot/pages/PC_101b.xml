<b>13. <i>Which is prior: a thing’s objective presence or its usefulness?</i></b> The being of tools is their usefulness. But this is
not just some “interpretation,”
<span style="color:magenta;" title="Yes, [it is an interpretation] but only of how things are encountered. [German:
Aber doch nur Begegnischarakter.]">☞</span>
i.e., we are not reading usefulness “into” tools or slapping a subjective label onto
objectively present stuff. To do that, we would have to
<br/>
• first discover something as objectively present
<br/>
• and then establish the priority of experiencing the objectively present over the useful.
<br/>
However, that would contradict what we have already established: that theoretical knowledge of objects is <i>derivative</i>
from the engagement with meaning. Moreover, to take something as just objectively present we have to <i>work through</i>
its prior presence as useful. <i>Usefulness is the ontological-categorial in-itself-ness of what we first encounter.</i>
<br/>
Let us—for a moment—allow the objection that something has to be “objectively out there” before it can be
useful. But does that mean that usefulness is ontologically rooted in objective presence?
