<b>13. <i>Which is prior: a thing’s objective presence or its usefulness?</i></b> The being of tools is their usefulness. But this is
not just some “interpretation,”<sup>¶</sup> i.e., we are not reading usefulness “into” tools or slapping a subjective label onto
objectively present stuff. To do that, we would have to

• first discover something as objectively present
</p>
<p id="PC_100c">
• and then establish the priority of experiencing the objectively present over the useful.

However, that would contradict what we have already established: that theoretical knowledge of objects is <i>derivative</i>
from the engagement with meaning. Moreover, to take something as just objectively present we have to <i>work through</i>
its prior presence as useful. <i>Usefulness is the ontological-categorial in-itself-ness of what we first encounter.</i>

Let us—for a moment—allow the objection that something has to be “objectively out there” before it can be
useful. But does that mean that usefulness is ontologically rooted in objective presence?
