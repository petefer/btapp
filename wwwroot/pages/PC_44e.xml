<b>10. <i>SZ II.1: Kant on being and time.</i></b> Positively the destruction is focused on (1) the togetherness of time and being in
the history of ontology, and on (2) whether or not ur-temporality ever was or could have been worked out in principle.

Driven by the phenomena themselves, Kant’s doctrine of schematism was the first and only attempt to broach the
question of ur-temporality. However, after SZ I.3 works out ur-temporality, SZ II.1 [= GA 3,
<i>Kant and the Problem of Metaphysics</i>, orig. 1929] will show (1) how obscure Kant’s doctrine of schematism was, (2) how and why it entirely
misses ur-temporality (cf. his designation of schematism as “an art hidden in the depths of the soul,”
<i>Critique of Pure Reason</i> B 180f.), and (3) why he shrank back from it.

If we hope to show how being is intelligible, we have to clarify, explicitly and in principle, ur-temporality and the
phenomena entailed by it—which is difficult precisely because (as Kant puts it) this entails the <i>most hidden</i> judgments
of “common reason,” which, he says, is the “philosopher’s job” to analyze.
