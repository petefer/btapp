<b>1. <i>I am related to myself, thrown into myself, and concerned for myself.</i></b>
What we are going to analyze is ourselves.<sup>¶</sup>
Always and in each case:<br />
• My being is mine.<br />
• My being entails that I relate to my being.<sup>¶</sup><br />
• I am delivered over to [= thrown into] my own being.<br />
• <i>Being</i><sup>¶</sup> is a concern for me.<br />
Two consequences follow from these four theses about ex-sistence.
