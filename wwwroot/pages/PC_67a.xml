What we are going to analyze is ourselves.<span title="In each case [that means] “I.” [ Ed. The scare quotes indicate that
the “I” is not the ego as traditionally understood.]">☞</span>
Always and in each case:

clearly that is what he means. The word Dasein appears only in the last sentence of this paragraph.">◊</span>

• My being is mine.<br />
• My being entails that I relate to my being.
<span title="But this being that I relate to is a historical engagement with
meaning [German: Aber dieses ist geschichtliches In-der-Welt-sein]. [See Editor’s note. * ]">☞</span>
<span style="color:magenta;" title="Ontologically (i.e., ex-sistentially—that is, in its very being as Existenz) human beings are self-related: 
their being is to be related to their being. Cf. Søren Kierkegaard, The Sickness unto Death, 13:
@biblio “A human being is spirit. But what is spirit? Spirit is the self. But what is the self? 
The self is a relation that relates itself to itself or is the relation's relating itself to itself in the relation; 
the self is not the relation but is the relation's relating itself to itself.”">◊</span>

• I am delivered over to [= thrown into] my own being.<br />
• <i>Being</i><span title="Which being? [Answer:] To be the open and thus to sustain being in general.
[German: Welches? Das Da zu sein und darin das Seyn überhaupt zu bestehen.] [Ed. Taking “Da” and “Seyn” as
both referring to the clearing, the sense seems to be: The kind of being (namely, IExistenz) that is a concern for
me consists in having to be and to sustain the clearing.]">☞</span> is a concern for me.<br />
Two consequences follow from these four theses about ex-sistence.
