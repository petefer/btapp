<b>9. <i>Everydayness gives access to our ex-sistentiality.</i></b> Everydayness is not a mere “aspect” of our ex-sistence. Even
when I live my everydayness inauthentically, it still has the a priori structure of ex-sistentiality, just as inauthenticity
does. In normal everydayness I am always relating to my ex-sistence; it remains a concern for me even when I flee it
or forget about it.
