<b>11. <i>Ex-sistential vs. categorial spatiality.</i></b> There is a distinction between (1) the ex-sistential engagement with
the world of meaning that goes with human being, and (2) the categorial being-in-space that goes with things.
However, ex-sistence does have its own form of spatiality, an <i>ex-sistential spatiality</i> based on our engagement
with meaning. But this distinction does not map onto a distinction between “spiritual space” and “bodily space,”
as if man were a “spiritual entity” deposited into material space.” Those are categorial-metaphysical terms that
only obscure what we mean by ex-sistence. We will have to do further work on the engagement with meaning
[especially in §§ 14-18] before we can get to ex-sistential spatiality [in §§ 22-24].
