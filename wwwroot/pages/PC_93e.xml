<b>12. <i>No. 4: the ex-sistential structure of any ex-sistentiel world of meaning.</i></b> In this fourth case “the world of meaning”
is an ex-sistential concept and refers to the being (the meaning-giving structure) of any particular lived world of
meaning as referenced in no. 3. “The world of meaning” is thus a technical term referring to the a priori—the essence,
the essential structure—of all ex-sistentiel worlds of meaning.

N.B. We will employ scare quotes when referring to things that that lack ex-sistence (“world”) and write the word
without square quotes (world) when referring to the world of meaning. [See Editor’s note. *]
