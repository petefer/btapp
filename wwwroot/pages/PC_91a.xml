<b>1. <i>Our focus: meaning as such.</i></b> In studying our engagement with meaning, we first focus on the world of meaning,
i.e., meaning as such. This is what shows up in the things we encounter, although it is often taken for granted and
overlooked.
<br/>
We could follow the traditional path and give a merely ontic description of things in the world, a long list of what
we encounter: houses, trees, people, stars, and so on. But no matter how finely we describe their appearances and
discuss what accounts for them, this would still be a pre-phenomenological exercise and would not get beyond things.
But we are after the being of things—i.e., how things are meaningfully present. That is what we called the proper
phenomenological sense of phenomena. (SZ 35b).
