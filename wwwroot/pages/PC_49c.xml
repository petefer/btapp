<b>20. <i>We should not overestimate the results of this study.</i></b> Because “the thing itself is deeply veiled”<sup>1</sup>
(<i>Critique of Pure Reason</i> B 121), we should not overestimate the results of this inquiry. There’s the constant possibility of finding an
even more fundamental and universal horizon for the question “What does ‘being’ mean? What accounts for it?”<sup>¶</sup>
Nonetheless, we must first reawaken the question and deal with it in an organized fashion so that, in the event, we can
confront any further possibilities seriously and with positive results.

¶ <b>20, “What does ‘being’ mean? What accounts for it?”</b> I use a hendiadys to capture the two possible meanings of
“was heißt ‘Sein’?” where the German verb can mean “means, is called” and/or “evokes” (cf. GA 8: <i>Was heißt Sein?</i>)
