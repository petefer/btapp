<b>¶ 8 <i>Schicksal</i> is living one’s authentic temporality and historicity</b>
<br/>
<i>A. My existential aheadness lets me be free for my death</i><br/>
1. Existentially I am already ahead. Thus existentielly, in resolve, I can become free for my death (“shatter against it”), and be thrown back into my present world of meaning.<br/>
<i>B. That is, my existential aheadness lets me free up a possibility</i><br/>
2. I am always-already ahead, ex-sistent, and thus can free up a possibility for myself from my legacy and live with insight “in my time.”<br/>
<i>C. In short, temporality makes authentic historicity possible</i><br/>
3. Finite, authentic temporality makes possible <i>Schicksal</i>, i.e., my authentic historicity.<br/>
