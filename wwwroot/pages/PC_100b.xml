<b>11. <i>The referral-structure of a job (2), cont.: How nature is present in the thing being made.</i></b>
Here “nature” means
nature as <i>usable</i> rather than nature as “just out there” or “the power of nature.” We can nature as an “objective element”
of the tool and the product, but that requires abstracting from nature as <i>useful</i> and turning it into an object of theory.
Doing so conceals the relation of nature as enthralling, overpowering, and useful. This happens, for example, when
we study the flowers in our garden from the perspective of a botanist.
