<b>13. <i>“Worldly” vs. “within the world of meaning.”</i></b> (1) We will use the adjective “worldly” [<i>weltlich</i>] not in its usual
sense but rather as referring to “living in worlds of meaning.” Hence it applies exclusively to ex-sistence.
(2) We
will refer to objectively present things as “<i>belonging to</i> the world of meaning” or as “<i>within</i> the world of meaning.”

[Ed.: Heidegger here contrasts “Weltgehörig” (things as merely belonging to the world of meaning) and
“Welthörig” (ex-sistence as inextricably bound up with the world of meaning).">☞</span>
