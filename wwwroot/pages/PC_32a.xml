<b>1. <i>Science, including ontology, is a possibility of ex-sistence.</i></b> Husserl argues that science is the ensemble
of fundamentally coherent true propositions, but this definition is not complete and fails to get to the
meaning of science. Doing science is one possibility of our ex-sistence—but only <i>one</i> possibility and not
the closest one to us. To anticipate: Ex-sistence is distinctive by comparison with other things.
