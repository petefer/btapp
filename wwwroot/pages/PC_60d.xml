<b>31. <i>Accidental and necessary covered-up-ness. How phenomena can degenerate.</i></b> The covered-up-ness of a
phenomenon (whether as hidden, forgotten, or distorted) can be either accidental or necessary. By “necessary” we
mean: grounded in the very nature of the thing that is covered up. A phenomenon that is drawn from original sources
can degenerate when it gets communicated as a proposition, or gets understood vacuously and passed along as an
ungrounded thesis. Phenomenology itself can become inflexible and unable to hold on to what it once grasped.
Therefore, phenomenology must become self-critical in a positive sense.
