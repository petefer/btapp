“hidden” may be either necessary or accidental:

&nbsp;&nbsp; • <i>accidental</i>, which may occur in various ways. A concept that originated in direct firstperson
experience can later degenerate by getting passed on in propositional form, or
circulated without serious thought, or used as a thesis without being explained.
Phenomenology itself can become inflexible and unable to hold on to what it once
grasped. That is why phenomenology has to become self-critical in a positive sense.
