<b>31. <i>Necessary and accidental forms of “hiddenness.”</i></b> The ways that a phenomenon can be
“hidden” may be either necessary or accidental:
<br/>
• <i>necessary</i>, when the reason for the hiddenness lies in the very nature of the
phenomenon that is hidden;<span style="color:magenta;" title="This is an intimation of what Heidegger finally thematized in December of 1930, namely
the intrinsic hiddenness of the clearing. See GA 9: 193.24-27 = 148.12-14 and Sheehan, Making
Sense of Heidegger, 223-38.">◊</span>
<br/>
• <i>accidental</i>, which may occur in various ways. A concept that originated in direct firstperson
experience can later degenerate by getting passed on in propositional form, or
circulated without serious thought, or used as a thesis without being explained.
Phenomenology itself can become inflexible and unable to hold on to what it once
grasped. That is why phenomenology has to become self-critical in a positive sense.
