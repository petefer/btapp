<b>7. <i>Two of the elements of the question about being.</i></b> First, <i>das Gefragte</i>: We are questioning <i>things</i>, but
what we asking <i>about</i> them is their being, which is not a thing at all. Rather, being is what determines that
something <i>is</i>; it is what we understand when we understand that something <i>is</i>. Therefore, we may not
approach being as if it were a thing, nor can we trace it back to a source in yet another thing. That would be
what Plato calls “spinning a yarn” (μῦθόν τινα διηγεῖσθαι, <i>Sophist</i> 242c8). Rather we have to show how
being is different from any thing.

Secondly, <i>das Erfragte</i>: What we are asking for (i.e., what we hope to find out about being) is
<i>what accounts for the intelligibility</i> of being, i.e., how it is that we can understand being. The concepts we use
for <i>that</i> will be different from the concepts we use for <i>things</i>.
