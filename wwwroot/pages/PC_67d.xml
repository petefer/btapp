<b>4. <i>Mineness.</i></b>
The being that I am always concerned about is, in every instance, <i>mine</i>. Ex-sistence is not a genus that
encompasses things in the world. (Such things do not and cannot have concern—or lack of concern—for themselves.)
The fact that ex-sistence is “always mine”—whoever the person is, ex-sistence is always his or her <i>very own</i> exsistence—
entails that we must always use a personal pronoun: “I,” “you,” etc., when speaking of ex-sistence.
