<b>10. <i>Chronological time as a series of nows.</i></b>
“Time” has long functioned as an ontic criterion for distinguishing
various realms of things:
<span style="color:magenta;" title="The scare quotes in what follows indicate that Heidegger is using
“time,” “temporal,” and “timeless” in a sense other than his own.">◊</span><br />
  • the “temporal” (natural occurrences, historical happenings) vs. the “non-temporal” (spatial and numerical
relations);<br />
  • “timeless” propositions vs. the “temporal” assertions of such propositions;<br />
  • “temporal” things vs. the supra-temporal or eternal.<br />
In the above cases “time” and “temporal” refer to things that are “within time,” where “time” is understood as a
series of now-moments. Obscure though it is, such “temporalness” has been taken as a criterion for distinguishing
realms of reality. No one bothers to ask why that is the case, much less search for the deeper meaning underlying
this naïve truism. Instead, it is taken as self-evident that time is simply a series of now-moments.
