<b>26. <i>phenomenon in the phenomenological sense.</i></b> We now make the crucial move from the
merely formal, ordinary meaning of phenomenon and to a phenomenon in the properly
phenomenological sense. As contrasted with the formal sense of “phenomenon” as <i>what appears</i>,
a phenomenon in the phenomenological sense usually does <i>not</i> appear but remains hidden.
Nonetheless, it belongs essentially to the thing-that-appears—in fact, it is its meaning and its
ground, meaning of the term, is crucial: a phenomenon in the phenomenological sense is not the <i>thing</i> that
appears but the <i>being</i> of the thing that appears, that is: how and as what the thing is significant and
meaningful to us.
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The “how” and “as what”—the being of what appears—usually goes unobserved and
remains “hidden,”

even though it constitutes the fundamental structure of the thing that appears.
The being of the thing constitutes the thing's intelligibility and its basis.

Editorial note: (1) The German of the text to which Heidegger's refers reads: “daß es
seinen Sinn und Grund ausmacht”: the being of a thing constitutes the intelligibility and
basis of the thing (SZ 35.25 = 59.30f.).
(2) The phrase “Wahrheit des Seins” in Heidegger's note could have two meanings.
Usually it refers to intelligibility-as-such (the clearing), i.e., intelligibility in the primary
sense, which, in turn, makes it possible for things to be intelligible in a secondary sense.
Here, however, it refers to that secondary sense, i.e., the intelligibility of a thing that shows
up in the clearing. See von Herrmann, I, 344.33-345.7.">☞</span>
