<b>26. <i>The de-formalized phenomenon of our study is something hidden.</i></b> In this study, the <i>de</i>-formalized and
distinctively phenomenological sense of phenomenon differs from the ordinary, formal sense of phenomenon.
Whenever we <i>explicitly</i> spell something out and exhibit it, the theme of such exhibiting is <i>necessarily</i> the <i>being</i> of the
thing, which is something that<br />
 • in contrast to what first and foremost shows up, usually does <i>not</i> show up but remains <i>hidden</i>,<br />
 • and yet <i>belongs</i> to what usually shows up; in fact it constitutes its meaning and ground.<sup>¶</sup>
