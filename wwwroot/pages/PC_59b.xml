<b>26. <i>phenomenon in the phenomenological sense.</i></b> We now make the crucial move from the
merely formal, ordinary meaning of phenomenon and to a phenomenon in the properly
phenomenological sense. As contrasted with the formal sense of “phenomenon” as <i>what appears</i>,
a phenomenon in the phenomenological sense usually does <i>not</i> appear but remains hidden.
Nonetheless, it belongs essentially to the thing-that-appears—in fact, it is its meaning and its
ground, meaning of the term, is crucial: a phenomenon in the phenomenological sense is not the <i>thing</i> that
appears but the <i>being</i> of the thing that appears, that is: how and as what the thing is significant and
meaningful to us.

Editorial note: (1) The German of the text to which Heidegger's refers reads: “daß es
seinen Sinn und Grund ausmacht”: the being of a thing constitutes the intelligibility and
basis of the thing (SZ 35.25 = 59.30f.).
(2) The phrase “Wahrheit des Seins” in Heidegger's note could have two meanings.
Usually it refers to intelligibility-as-such (the clearing), i.e., intelligibility in the primary
sense, which, in turn, makes it possible for things to be intelligible in a secondary sense.
Here, however, it refers to that secondary sense, i.e., the intelligibility of a thing that shows
up in the clearing. See von Herrmann, I, 344.33-345.7.">☞</span>
