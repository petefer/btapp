<b>6. <i>Using a tool reveals its being.</i></b>
Things show up <i>as useful</i> only when we deal with them appropriately. And when we
use a tool—for example, a hammer—we don’t focus explicitly on it “as a tool” or on its being as “referred-to-atask”—
and yet, in hammering, we know exactly what the hammer is for. Our concern with the hammer gets absorbed
in the <i>purpose</i> that defines the tool as a tool.

The being of the tool does not show up if we just stare at the thing; it comes to life only when we actually use
it. Using it lets us see that the way it is meaningfully present—i.e., the <i>being</i> of the tool—is its <i>usefulness</i>. That is
what the tool is “in itself”; and only because we implicitly understand that can we start hammering nails with it. Just
staring at the thing, merely “observing it theoretically,” will not reveal its usefulness.

<b><i>The kind of knowledge that goes with practical activity.</i></b> Our practical dealings are not blind but have their
own kind of “sight,” namely knowledge in the form of <i>know-how</i>. That know-how guides the activity and defines the
tool as useful. In dealing with tools, we said, we get absorbed in the <i>purpose</i> of the tool. The know-how that goes with
such activity is what I call <i>foresight</i>.
