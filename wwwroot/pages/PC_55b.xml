<b>14. <i>A preview of what immediately follows.</i></b> The goal of this § 7 is to arrive at the
<i>phenomenological</i> concept of a phenomenon. But that requires further precision
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; • regarding the <i>formal and ordinary</i> concept of phenomenon, and particularly
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; • regarding how that formal concept operates in the ordinary activity of making sense of
