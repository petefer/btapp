<b>4. <i>Scientific crises and paradigm shifts.</i></b> Progress in the sciences happens by way of more or less radical
paradigm shifts. A science’s ability to undergo such paradigm shifts indicates how far that science has
progressed. When a crisis arises between the relation between (1) a particular scientific method and (2)
what it investigates comes, the current paradigm becomes unstable. In fact, this is beginning to happen with
a number of sciences today.
