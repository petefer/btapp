<b>28. <i>A phenomenological ontology.</i></b> Phenomenology is the way we access, demonstrate, and determine the issues of
ontology. <i>Ontology is possible only as phenomenology.</i> The phenomenon here is being, its intelligibility, its
modifications, and its derivations. Being* is a distinctive form of self-showing, and it does not appear-via-another.
There is nothing “behind it” that “does not appear.”
