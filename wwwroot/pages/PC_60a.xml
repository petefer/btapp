<b>28. <i>A phenomenological ontology.</i></b> Ontology is the study of the being of things, and
phenomenology is the method by which we access, describe, demonstrate, and define the being of
things. <i>Phenomenology is the only way to do ontology.</i> The phenomenon we study in the present
work is the being of things: its intelligibility, its modifications, and its derivative forms. However,
being—in phenomenological terms, the significance of things—is a distinctive form of
appearance.
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; • It is not an instance of appearance-3 in the derivative sense (see ¶ 8 above), that is: it
is not something that appears through a symptom while remaining hidden in itself.
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; • It is not an instance of appearance-4, a “mere appearance” in Kant's sense. There is
nothing “behind” the being of things, no hidden “something-that-does-not-appear.”
