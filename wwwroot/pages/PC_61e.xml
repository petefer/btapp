<b>35. <i>The content is ontology; the method is hermeneutics.</i></b> As regards its <i>content</i>, phenomenology
is ontology, the science of the being of things, with emphasis on the question of how being is
understandable and understood. § 4 showed that all ontology rests on a <i>fundamental</i> ontology
which is (1) focused on our ex-sistent selves as ontically-ontologically distinct and (2) seeks to
answer the question of how being is intelligible at all.<span style="color:magenta;" title="Being as such is not a
genus, it is not meant in the sense of being as the inner structure of everything that is. The phrase
“as such” translates katholou and refers to being itself as a whole [= the clearing] as distinct from
the being of all things. This is the meaning and import of the ontological difference. [Sein—keine
Gattung, nicht das Sein für das Seiende im allgemeinen; das ‘überhaupt’ = καθόλου = im Ganzen
von: Sein des Seienden; Sinn der Differenz. GA 2: 50 n. “a”].
Editorial note: (1) Of necessity, this compact and difficult note is strongly paraphrased in
order to bring out its meaning. (See von Herrmann, I, 367.) Heidegger is stressing the
ontological difference between
• the clearing taken by itself and as a whole: here, Sein überhaupt, [Sein selbst] im
Ganzen—and
• the metaphysical notion of the beingness (ousia, Seiendheit) as common ground of
everything that is (das Sein für das Seiende im allgemeinen).">☞</span>

As regards its method, phenomenological description is hermeneutical in four distinct
senses of that term.<span style="color:magenta;" title="The noun hermēneia has at least three
meanings in Aristotle.
hermēneia-1: The most basic meaning is any expression, animal or human, that intends to
communicate in any form.
hermēneia-2: An expression that communicates in a form of speech (dialectos: De Anima
II 8, 420b20.
hermēneia-3: An expression that communicates in a declarative sentence (apophansis). See
Sheehan, “Hermeneia and Apophansis: The Early Heidegger's Reading of De interpretatione”
and Sense and Meaning: From Aristotle to Heidegger,” 273ff.">◊</span>
<br />
1. The most general methodological sense: The term “hermeneutic” corresponds to
the <i>logos</i>-element of phenomeno-<i>logy</i>, which is a <i>hermēneuein</i> in the original
Greek sense of “spelling something out,” i.e., explaining what it means We will
employ hermeneutic in <i>this</i> sense as the method for working out the fundamental
ontology that constitutes all of SZ I. What we are “spelling out” is the lived
experience of our own ex-sistence (= SZ I.1-2), with the goal of finding out how
the being of things is intelligible (= SZ I.3).
<br />
2. <i>An extended sense</i>: This hermeneutic also spells out the conditions of possibility
for investigating <i>non</i>-ex-sistent entities.<span style="color:magenta;" title="This is the first
reference in SZ to the metontology that Heidegger projected in GA 26: 196-202 = 154-59, an
ontology that follows after (meta) fundamental ontology and is devoted to the being of various
kinds of things, including ex-sistence qua ontic. See also the Editorial note to ¶ 37, below.">◊</span>
<br />
3. <i>The primary sense of “hermeneutic” in this text<i>: Since we ourselves are the entities
that SZ will investigate, the term “hermeneutic” in the present study refers primarily
to <i>spelling out our own ex-sistence</i>. The book is a hermeneutic of our exsistentiality,
our unique way of being.
<br />
4. <i>A fourth and derivative sense</i>: Insofar as the aforementioned primary sense of the
term entails spelling out our own historicity, “hermeneutic” can also be taken in a
derivative sense as the methodology for studying humanistic disciplines. The
humanities study elements of our ex-sistential historicity, and as §§ 72-77 will
demonstrate, our historicity is the necessary condition of all humanistic studies.
