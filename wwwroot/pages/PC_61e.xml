<b>35. <i>Subject matter: ontology. Method: hermeneutics.</i></b> The <i>subject matter</i> of phenomenology is ontology, the science of
being. But in order to get to the key issue—what accounts for being—ontology requires a <i>fundamental</i> ontology of the
ontically-ontologically distinctive entity: ex-sistence.

The <i>methodological</i> meaning of phenomenological description is ἑρμηνεία. We distinguish four meanings of the
term:<br />
 1. The original sense of ἑρμηνεύειν is: <i>to make something known</i> by articulating [<i>Auslegen</i>, spelling out]
its being.<br />
 2. A second sense: articulating the being of any and all <i>non</i>-ex-sistential things. (The horizon for this task
is established by analyzing the being of ex-sistence and establishing what accounts for the
intelligibility of being in general.)<sup>¶</sup><br />
 3. The philosophically primary sense of ἑρμηνεία is: the spelling out of the ex-sistentiality of ex-sistence.
This is the primary sense of the term insofar as ex-sistence has ontological priority over other entities.<br />
 4. A derivative sense of the term is: the methodology of the historical humanities. This derives from the
fact that the ex-sistentiality of ex-sistence includes historicity.

¶ 35, Being is not a genus, it is not [“being” in the sense of] being for things in general; the phrase “in general”
[überhaupt] = καθόλου = the whole of the being of things; the notion [Sinn] of difference.
