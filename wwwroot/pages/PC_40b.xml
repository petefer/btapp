<b>12. <i>Ur-temporality [Temporalität].</i></b> The goal of SZ I.3 is to understand the ur-temporal (or “original-temporal”)
character of being (as vs. things that are “within time”). SZ I.3 will demonstrate that<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;• being is always grasped in terms of time and<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;• all modes and derivations of being become intelligible in terms of time.
This requires that we revise our terminology.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;• “Time” will longer mean a series of now-moments.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;• “Temporal” will no longer mean “being within time-as-a-series-of-now-moments.”<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;• Even the being of the “supra-temporal” and the “non-temporal” will be shown to be temporal in a positive
sense.<br />
In saying that being, along with its modes and features, are determined by time, we are using that term a different
sense from the usual one. By “time” we mean “ur-temporality” [henceforth: “ur-temporality”; in German:
<i>Temporalität</i>]. Fundamental ontology is a matter of demonstrating that <i>ur-temporality</i> is what accounts for the
intelligibility of being.
