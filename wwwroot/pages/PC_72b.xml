<b>3. <i>We do not begin with an “ego” or a “subject.”</i></b> But we do not begin “historically” by positing an ego or a
subject as if that were the first datum we encounter. Doing so means missing what we <i>actually</i> experience in
our ex-sistence. Other approaches still end up positing an ontological <i>subiectum</i> or ὑποκείμενον [“something
that underlies something else”], no matter how much those approaches reject a “substantial soul” and the
“reification of consciousness.”
<br/>
Reification [cf. <i>res</i>, “thing”] entails turning the being of something into a form of “thing-ness.” We
first have to clarify the ontological source of such reification before we can say what a <i>non</i>-reified subject or
non-thing-like consciousness might mean <i>positively</i>. We <i>could</i> investigate the areas of experience named as
“subject,” “consciousness,” and the like, but instead we will focus on the <i>being</i> of such entities. For reasons of
principle we will avoid terms like “subject” and “consciousness” (along with “life” and “man”) as we explain
the unique kind of “thing” that we ourselves are.
