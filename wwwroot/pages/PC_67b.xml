<b>2. <i>The “essence” of` human being.</i></b>
My “essence”—my basic way of being—is: <i>I-can-and-must-achieve-myself</i> [<i>Zusein</i>].<span title="This is what ex-sistence is determined to be! – namely, the fact that it “has” it to be. [German: daß
es zu seyn “hat”; Bestimmung!] [See Editor’s note. * ]">☞</span> To use traditional language, my “essence (<i>essentia</i>) must be read in terms of my being (<i>existentia</i>). My being
is ex-sistence [<i>Existenz</i>]—but not in the traditional sense of <i>existentia</i>, which means “just-being there.” To avoid
confusion, the traditional meaning of <i>existentia</i> will be called “objective presence,” and the word “ex-sistence”
[<i>Existenz</i>] will be reserved for the kind of being that humans have.
