<b>7. <i>The ultimate goal: not philosophical anthropology but what makes being intelligible.</i></b> The ultimate goal of this
preparatory analysis is to work out the question of what accounts for being. SZ I.1 will not provide a complete
regional ontology of ex-sistence—something that would be necessary if we wanted to construct an adequate
philosophical anthropology or to provide the ontological foundations for that.<sup>n</sup> At best our analysis will provide
some elements for such an anthropology, and important ones at that.

SZ I.1 is both an <i>incomplete</i> and a <i>provisional</i> analysis of ex-sistence: it merely <i>lays out</i> the structures of exsistence’s
way of being while leaving the <i>interpretation</i> of those structures for SZ I.2. SZ I.1 merely prepares for
establishing ex-sistence’s temporality as the horizon [in § 65 [on temporality]. SZ I.1 merely prepares for
establishing temporality. Thereafter [in SZ I.2, chapter 4] we will <i>reinterpret</i> the structures of SZ I.1 at a more
advanced and properly ontological level.<sup>n</sup>
