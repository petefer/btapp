<b>7. <i>The ultimate goal: not philosophical anthropology but what makes being intelligible.</i></b> The ultimate goal of this
preparatory analysis is to work out the question of what accounts for being. SZ I.1 will not provide a complete
regional ontology of ex-sistence—something that would be necessary if we wanted to construct an adequate
philosophical anthropology or to provide the ontological foundations for that. At best our analysis will provide
some elements for such an anthropology, and important ones at that.
