<b>36. <i>Being as transcendental.</i></b> Being pertains to every thing and yet is not a genus of things. That is, its universality is
<i>transcendental</i>: it transcends all things and all genera and species of things. Being is the <i>transcendens</i> pure and
simple.<span style="color:magenta;" title="Certainly not transcendens in the scholastic and Greek-Platonic
sense of κοινόν [common], despite all the metaphysical resonance [of the word]. Rather, transcendence as the exstatic—
temporality—ur-temporality, but as a “horizon”! The clearing [Seyn] is to be thought as beyond things. But
transcendence is due to the openedness of the clearing [Seyn]: appropriation.">☞</span>
<br/>
The transcendence that characterizes the being of ex-sistence is distinctive in that it implies radical <i>individuation</i>.
Showing being as the <i>transcendens</i> is <i>transcendental</i> knowledge. Phenomenological disclosure = the disclosure of
being = <i>veritas transcendentalis</i>.
