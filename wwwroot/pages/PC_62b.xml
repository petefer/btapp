<b>36. <i>Being as transcendental.</i></b> Being pertains to every thing and yet is not a genus of things. That is, its universality is
<i>transcendental</i>: it transcends all things and all genera and species of things. Being is the <i>transcendens</i> pure and
simple.<sup>22</sup>

The transcendence that characterizes the being of ex-sistence is distinctive in that it implies radical <i>individuation</i>.
Showing being as the <i>transcendens</i> is <i>transcendental</i> knowledge. Phenomenological disclosure = the disclosure of
being = <i>veritas transcendentalis</i>.
