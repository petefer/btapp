<b>1. <i>So-called “primitive” ex-sistence.</i></b> In speaking of <i>everyday</i> ex-sistence, we do not mean what ethnologists
call “primitive” ex-sistence [in the sense of “primitive” that ethnology and anthropology once used]. Everyday
ex-sistence is operative even in the most highly developed and differentiated cultures. What ethnology calls
“primitive” ex-sistence has a special kind of everydayness all its own <i>and</i> possibilities of ex-sistence that are
not everday.

Nonetheless, focusing an analysis of ex-sistence on the lives of “primitive” peoples might have a certain
methodological importance insofar as “primitive” ex-sistence is less cluttered with and obscured by extensive
self-interpretations and therefore could speak to us more directly about how we are absorbed in things.
