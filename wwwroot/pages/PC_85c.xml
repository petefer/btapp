<b>16. <i>Against subject-object thinking.</i></b> Our engagement with meaning is always somehow familiar to us. But the
effort to explicate it usually (and wrongly) takes theoretical knowledge as the chief example of how the “soul”
relates to the world. The two forms of such knowledge are noein (to have direct, intuitive knowledge of the
meaning of something) and logos (interpreting a thing as meaning this or that). These are taken as the primary
ways we are engaged with meaning—but without understanding that phenomenon as such.

This approach envisions a “relation” between one thing (the soul) and another thing (the world), in both
cases as things that are objectively present, and in so doing, <i>completely obscures</i> what we pre-theoretically
know and experience as the way we engage with meaning. This “self-evident” approach—that subjects related
to objects—then becomes the presupposition for epistemology and the metaphysics of knowledge. Yes, subjects
<i>do</i> relate to objects; but such an approach obscures the question of why that is necessary and what it means.
