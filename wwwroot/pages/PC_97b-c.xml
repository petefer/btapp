<b>5. <i>The being of tools as their “referredness” to a task.</i></b>
Strictly speaking there never is “a” tool or implement off by
itself: it always is found in connection with other tools. A set of tools is “in order to…,” it’s for “<i>doing</i> something.”
As a means to an end, it can serve to… (= serviceability), can be used for (= utility), and so on. The “is for” or “in
order to”—the tool’s serviceability or utility—is the the way the tool is meaningfully present. The being of a tool is
the tool’s <i>referredness</i> (as the means) to a certain task (the end to be achieved). We now seek to show the “ontological
genesis” of this phenomenon, i.e., how a tool’s being (its meaningful presence) comes about.

<i>We first encounter the useful in sets or wholes.</i> As useful, tools ex-sist <i>in relation to other</i> useful things,
e.g., paper in relation to pen, ink, desk, lamp, etc. It is <i>not</i> the case that we first experience them as “individual things,”
present “all by themselves,” which then only subsequently come together to form a set of such things. Rather, the <i>set</i>
or <i>whole</i> is what we first encounter as immediately present to us—for example, the room in which we are going to
write. And we encounter the room not as just four walls, but as something that is itself useful, e.g., for writing in. This
“context” lets us experience the <i>arrangement</i> of <i>things</i>, the set of things that we can make use of. Only then—that is,
only in terms of this prior arrangement or set—do we see things as <i>individual</i> tools.
