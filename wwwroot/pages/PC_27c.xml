<b>11. <i>But it is not a vicious circle.</i></b> There are three steps to our argument here:<br />
  • In order to know what and how something <i>is</i>, we must already have an implicit understanding of
being (the “is”).<br />
  • But we <i>do</i> know what and how things are; that is, we do have a <i>prior unthematic</i> understanding of
“is” and “are,” i.e., being.<br />
  • Therefore, our argument does not move in a vicious circle. We are not deriving or deducing
anything and certainly not deducing the meaning of being from the presupposed being of exsistence.<br />
The science of ontology has always presupposed and has been guided by this average, “lived”
understanding of being that <i>ultimately</i><sup>¶</sup> <i>belongs to the very structure of ex-sistence</i>. But we are not
<i>deducing</i> anything from it. We are simply trying to <i>show what accounts for</i> the already operative relation
between (1) our way of being and (2) the being of anything and everything.

d. h. von Anfang an].
