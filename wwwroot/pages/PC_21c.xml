<b>3. <i>This mistaken view derives from three correct presuppositions of Aristotelian ontology.</i></b> The claim that
an inquiry into being is unnecessary is rooted in <i>three presuppositions</i> of ancient Greek ontology, the basis
for our ontological categories. But before we can interpret that ontology and those categories [= SZ II], we
first have to clarify the question of being along with the very source of all concepts of being [= SZ I,
especially I.3]. In the present section we will simply review <i>three truths of traditional ontology</i> and the
<i>mistakes they lead to</i>, so as to see the need to re-ask the question of what accounts for being.
