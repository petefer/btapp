<b>1. <i>How does meaning as such show up in the everyday?</i></b>
The world of meaning is not a thing <i>within</i> meaning but
rather that which lets things be meaningful. In fact, without the world of meaning, things would not show up for us
at all. But how do I actually come to experience the world of meaning?
<br/>
We are always engaged with meaning, and that includes always making sense of ourselves. So, I must have some
implicit, pre-theoretical familiarity with meaning as such. (One doesn’t need an ontology for that.) But how exactly
does the world of meaning show up <i>in and with</i> the things I encounter in my concerned engagement with meaning?
Do I already have a pre-theoretical, lived experience of it? Yes, even when I’m absorbed in my daily tasks, the world
of meaning can “light up” for me along with the things I’m dealing with.
