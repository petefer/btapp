<b>1. <i>The ontic sciences overlook ex-sistence.</i></b> Having stated the positive goals of this work, we now distinguish it
from sciences like anthropology, psychology, and biology, which study human beings, often fruitfully, but fall
short of their goal because they omit the being of human beings.<span title="They simply never aimed at ex-sistence. [German: Sie zielten ganz
und gar nicht auf Dasein.]">☞</span> Our own investigation is <i>ontological</i>, and for
that reason our distinctions will not satisfy the theory of science governing those other disciplines. However,
the scientific <i>structure</i> of those disciplines (not the <i>attitude</i> of the scientists) is entirely questionable and needs
to be shaken up from an ontological standpoint.
