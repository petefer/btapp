<b>10. <i>The referral-structure of a job (2): the “out-of-which” (τὸ ἐξ οὗ).</i></b>
The thing I produce is not just useful <i>for</i>
something. In producing it, I make it <i>out of</> something, which is also included in the referral-structure of the job.
Likewise the tools I use. This hammer, for example, is made out of wood and steel, which have a reference to trees
and earth, things that naturally “produce themselves” (cf. <i>phusis</i> / ϕύσις) even when cultivated by humans. Hence, in
knowing how to use the hammer, nature is also present..
