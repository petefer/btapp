<b>1. <i>Summary of the foregoing. Goal of the present section.</i></b>
In the last two sections we saw three things:
</p>
<p id="PC_107d">
• In §15, SZ 68c, we mentioned the referral of tools to tasks, but all too briefly. We said we would have to
work out its ontological structure.</p>
<p id="PC_107d">
• We established that the referrals that relate a tool to a task constitute the essence of a world of practical
meaning.</p>
<p id="PC_107d">
• In §16 we showed how such a world can light up when useful things are damaged, go missing, or are in the
way.</p>
<p id="PC_107d" class="noindent">
In the present section we take a further step in understanding the being of things we use. We want to lay an experiential
foundation for understanding what a world of practical meaning is and how it operates.
