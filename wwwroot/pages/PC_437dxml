<b>¶ 9 Thematic resolve is retrieval. How retrieval does and does not function.</b>
<br/>
<i>A. Resolve can become retrieval</i><br/>
1. In resolve I needn’t know explicitly the origin of the possibility I choose.<br/>
2. But temporality makes it possible for me to bring to light explicitly the existentiel possibility I’ve liberated from traditional notions of ex-sistence.<br/>
3. Resolve, i.e., returning to my aheadness and freeing myself up, can become the retrieval of a received-and-still-available possibility.<sup>22</sup><br/>
4. Retrieval is explicitly freeing up—that is, thematically returning to—existentiel possibilities that are already available.<br/>
5. Resolute anticipation makes possible the authentic retrieval of a received-and-still-available possibility of ex-sistence i.e., choosing one’s hero.<sup>23</sup><br/>
That is, in resolve I choose that which will free me for the struggle of following the direction of what can be retrieved, and remaining faithful to it.<sup>24</sup><br/>
<i>B. What retrieval is not</i><br/>
6. Retrieval frees up a received-and-still-available possibility of ex-sistence but not in order to reactualize it<br/>
7. not in order to “bring back the past” not in order to bind “the present” to what is “by-gone.”<br/>
8. Retrieval arises from a resolute understanding of oneself, and is not persuaded of what is “past,” nor does it seek to bring back what once was.<br/>
<i>C. What retrieval is</i><br/>
9. Retrieval is a considered response to a received-and-still-available possibility of ex-sistence.<br/>
10. It is made in a moment of existentiel insight that, as such, repudiates [the linear notion of] “the past” working itself out in “the present.”<br/>
11. Retrieval neither surrenders to the past nor aims at future progress.<br/>
12. In its moment of existentiel insight, ex-sistence is indifferent to both.<br/>
