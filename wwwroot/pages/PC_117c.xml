<b>5. <i>The “already” factor of ex-sistence.</i></b>
The fact that ex-sistence has always already (i.e., a priori/ontologically) opened
up a world of suitabilities is an element of what we call the “a priori perfect” nature of ex-sistence.<sup>¶</sup> I ex-sist as a
world of praxis, a field of possible means-to-ends relationships, which we referred to above as the suitability <i>of</i>
something <i>for</i> something. Accordingly, when my concern and foresight encounter something, I discover it to be
<i>already useful</i> (= I understand the thing’s current being as usefulness) rather than as just “something out there.”
