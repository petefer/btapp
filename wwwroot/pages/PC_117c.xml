<b>5. <i>The “already” factor of ex-sistence.</i></b>
The fact that ex-sistence has always already (i.e., a priori/ontologically) opened
up a world of suitabilities is an element of what we call the “a priori perfect” nature of ex-sistence.
<span title="[See Editor’s note. * ]
“Freeing up beforehand” refers to disclosing the being of things so that they can show up as what they are. Here
the term “beforehand” is used in an ontological sense. Latin expresses that as the a priori, anda Greek expresses it
as πρότερον τῇ ϕύσει / proteron tēi phusei (Aristotle, Physics A 1).
Metaphysics VI 1, 1025b28-29 states this more clearly as τὸ τί ἦν εἶναι / to ti ēn einai: “what it always already
‘was’ to be that thing,” “what something already is in each case,” its “alreadiness,” the per-fect. [German: “das was
schon war — sein,” “das jeweils schon voraus Wesende,” das Gewesene, das Perfekt].
Regarding τὸ τί ἦν εἶναι: In Greek the verb εἶναι (“to be”) does not have a form for the perfect tense, so Aristotle
expressed the perfect by the phrase ἦν εἶναι: “What it always already ‘was’ to be that thing.” But this is not a past
tense in the ontic sense. Rather, it refers to what in each case is prior. It is what we are directed back to when we
ask what a thing as such is, its being.
Instead of the phrase “a priori perfect” we could call it the ontological or transcendental perfect (cf. Kant’s
doctrine of the schematism).">☞</span>
 I ex-sist as a
world of praxis, a field of possible means-to-ends relationships, which we referred to above as the suitability <i>of</i>
something <i>for</i> something. Accordingly, when my concern and foresight encounter something, I discover it to be
<i>already useful</i> (= I understand the thing’s current being as usefulness) rather than as just “something out there.”
