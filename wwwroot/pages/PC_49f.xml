<b>3. <i>Phenomenology: not a subject matter but a method.</i></b> The question of what accounts for the intelligibility being is the
fundamental question of philosophy, and we will treat it <i>phenomenologically</i>. Phenomenology is not a standpoint or
special direction but a <i>method</i>: not a “what” (a specific subject matter) but a “how” (a way to do research) without,
however, devolving into a mere “technical device.” We must work out its genuine concept and principles as these are
rooted in a confrontation with the things themselves.
