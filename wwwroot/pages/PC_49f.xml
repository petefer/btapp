<b>3. <i>Phenomenology: a method rather than a subject matter.</i></b> The most fundamental question of
philosophy is “How is being intelligible?” We will treat that question phenomenologically, that is,
in terms of our own direct, first-person experience. Phenomenology is not a “philosophical
position,” and it doesn't have a set goal at which it aims. It is simply and exclusively a method. It
has no predetermined subject matter, no particular “what” that it investigates. Phenomenology is
a “how,” a way of carrying out any investigation at all. It is a method for the direct, first-person
encountering of things and must never devolve into a “technique,” of which there are plenty
enough around for pursuing theoretical disciplines.<br />
We need a clear concept of phenomenology as a method, and the clearer we get on that,
the more we will see that phenomenology evolves directly from how we relate to whatever we
encounter.
