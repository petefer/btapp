<b>19. <i>λόγος as ἀλήϑεια-2.</i></b> Λόγος, as just letting a thing be seen-<i>as-something</i>, can be ἀληϑής—but by that we do not
mean ἀλήϑεια in the derived sense of truth as the correspondence of S and P.<sup>n</sup> Λόγος = ἀληϑεύειν aka ἀποϕαίνεσϑαι:
taking the thing we are talking about <i>out of</i> [ἀ-] “hiddenness” [-ληϑ-] and letting it be seen as “un-hidden” (ἀληϑής)—in
short, dis-covering it.<sup>n</sup> The verb ψεύδεσϑαι means: to cover something up, to put it forth as what it is not.
