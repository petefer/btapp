<b>13. <i>Meaning is a priori.</i></b> Our relation to the world of meaning is not an add-on to our ex-sistence, nor is it some
metaphysical “property” that we have (much less have only “occasionally”). Without the engagement with
meaning we would not ex-sist, and we would be unable to relate to things. Nor does it come about because
things press in empirically on our senses. Something can encounter us only insofar as it shows up in a world of
meaning.
