<b>16. <i>Function-1: showing something in its meaning, whether correctly or not.</i></b>
A <i>logos</i> Aristotle
says, has the basic function of <i>dēloun</i>, making manifest what one is talking about. A <i>logos</i> makes
sense of a thing by displaying that thing (the subject of the sentence) in terms of a <i>specific</i> meaning
(represented by the predicate). Aristotle specifies the function of <i>dēloun</i> more precisely as <i>apophainesthai</i>
to display something (<i>-phainesthai</i>) in predicative terms that are drawn <i>from (apo-)
the thing itself</i>.<sup>1</sup> We can better understand <i>apophainesthai</i> by separating out its two component
parts, namely (1) “to display/make manifest,” and (2) “from.”<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp; • <i>--phainesthai</i>: When I perform an act of <i>logos</i>, I purport to manifest to myself or my
interlocutor how and as what something actually is.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; • <i>apo-</i>: Moreover, I draw the sense that I make of the thing <i>from the thing itself</i> rather
than from my feelings, desires, or hopes about the thing.

        In a de-clarative sentence (<i>apo-phansis</i>, de-claratio) 
I clarify the subject matter in predicative terms that are taken from (<i>apo</i>-, de-) 
the subject matter itself rather than from how I feel (etc.) about the subject matter. 
See the second Editorial note to ¶ 6, 
“Such things can appear as they are in many ways, depending on how we have access to them,” above.

An apophantic sentence (an assertion or proposition) makes the claim that what I am saying is an
unqualified fact. Such a sentence is in the indicative/declarative mood. In Greek it is called an
<i>apophansis</i>: it claims to show something (<i>-phansis</i>) as having a meaning that I draw <i>from (apo-)
the thing itself</i> rather than from my subjective attitudes about the thing. Declarative statements are
meaningful (i.e., understandable) regardless of whether the meaning is correct or not.

        At § 44 ¶ 23 (<a href="https://www.beyng.com/pages/de/SeinUndZeit/SeinUndZeit.220.html">SZ 220</a>.7ff. =

Heidegger will characterize this paragraph as a “dogmatic” presentation of <i>logos</i> 
and <i>alētheia</i> as contrasted with the phenomenological demonstration he provides in § 44.

&nbsp;&nbsp; However, not every meaningful sentence is in the indicative/declarative mood.

        Aristotle holds that every articulate utterance is meaningful/understandable: 
it can bring something present to mind; however, 
not every articulate utterance shows something <i>and</i> claims that what it shows is a fact.
(<i>De interpretatione</i> 17a 1-3: Every <i>logos</i> is meaningful/understandable, 
but not every <i>logos</i> necessarily declarative.) 
Grammatical moods are ways that I can express how I and my sentence are
related to the meaningful/understandable thing. Ancient Greek grammar knew of five moods
(<i>engkliseis</i>; singular, <i>engklisis</i>): the indicative (<i>hē horistikē</i> the imperative (<i>hē protatikē</i>), the optative
(hē eutikē), the subjunctive (<i>hē hypotaktikē</i>), and paradoxically the indefinite/infinitive 
(hē aparemphatos: cf. <i>a + para + en</i> + phainō: not-indicating-[a mood]).

For example, a request (<i>euchē</i>) such as “Please pass the salt” is understandable but neither true nor
false.
