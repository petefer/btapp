<b>16. <i>λόγoς as “letting something be seen.”</i></b> The original meaning of λόγoς/λέγειν is δηλοῦν, <i>to make manifest</i> that about
which one is talking. Aristotle specifies this as ἀποϕαίνεσθαι:<sup>1</sup><br />
 • ϕαίνεσθαι: to show what one is taking about, or to let it be seen by oneself or one’s interlocutors;<br />
 • ἀπό: to show it <i>from</i> the very thing one is talking about.

When the discourse is a de-clarative sentence (an ἀπό-ϕανσις) and is genuinely <i>meaningful</i> [regardless of whether it is
true or not], what-is-said [the predicate] is drawn <i>from</i> [ἀπό] what-is-spoken-about [the subject], so that the
communication takes what it is talking about and <i>shows-it-as</i>-something. Such a declarative sentence <i>exhibits</i>
something so that it can be <i>seen</i>. (A request—εὐχή—also reveals something, but differently.)
