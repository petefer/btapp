<b>13. <i>The phenomenological sense of phenomenon vs. the merely formal sense.</i></b> So far we have discussed only the
<i>formal</i> conception of phenomenon. In this formal and ordinary sense, a phenomenon
is whatever can be accessed by empirical intuition, a definition that applies to Kantian phenomena
as well. However, that leaves it undecided whether a genuine phenomenon (appearance-1) is
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; • a <i>thing</i>: a “what” or
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; • the <i>being</i> of a thing: a “how,” namely how the thing is significant
<br/>
To illustrate the <i>phenomenological</i> sense of phenomenon,
<button id="Btn54d1" style="color:magenta;">◊</button>
<dialog id="Dlg54d1">
    <p style="text-indent:2em;">
        The phenomenological concept of a phenomenon is the <i>being</i> of a genuine phenomenon. See ¶ 26 below.

    </form>
</dialog>
we will stay within the Kantian
framework for a moment. If we were to search for <i>phenomenological</i> phenomena in the 
<i>Critique of Pure Reason</i>, they would turn out to be not the empirical objects that show up in empirical
intuition but rather the <i>very forms of empirical intuition</i>. These forms are the “how” or “that
whereby” the data get ordered spatially and temporally. These forms of sense intuition (1) show
up and thus are phenomena and (2) accompany the empirical data while being prior to them. As
they are thematized in the Transcendental Aesthetic, these forms are phenomenological
phenomena.
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; As to how the forms of space and time <i>themselves</i> appear to us, Kant makes the
transcendental claim that the forms of sense intuition are the a priori structures within and whereby
(= the “how”) the data (= the “what”) get ordered; and the forms show up as such.
