<b>13. <i>The phenomenological sense of phenomenon vs. the merely formal sense.</i></b> So far we have discussed only the
<i>formal</i> conception of phenomenon. (That is, we have not said <i>which things</i> are phenomena or whether a phenomenon is
a <i>thing</i> or a characteristic of the <i>being</i> of a thing.) The <i>ordinary and formal</i> conception of phenomenon is whatever can
be accessed by empirical intuition, as is the case in Kant.

But what about the <i>phenomenological</i> conception of phenomenon? To use Kantian terms for a moment: the real
phenomena of phenomenology are not empirical objects but the <i>forms of empirical intuition</i> as the “wherein” of an
ordering of the data. These forms of empirical intuition <i>must show themselves</i> if Kant’s transcendental claims about
them are to be true.
