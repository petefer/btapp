<b>7. <i>Symptoms, symbols, indications, etc.: appearances” through which something else indirectly shows up.</i></b> The
symptom of a disease [no. 3 in the chart above] shows up as itself—for example, as a rash—but in turn the rash
indicates <i>something else</i>: a disturbance that is really there but does not show up directly. Here we have “the appearance
of a disease <i>through</i> a symptom.”
</p>
<p id="PC_52a">
The disease does not show up directly for itself; instead, it is made manifest via the symptom that <i>does</i> show up.
Thus “appearing by way of something else” is <i>not</i> a showing-of-itself.<sup>¶</sup> (However, this “not” is different from the
privative “not” of mere semblance [cf. paragraph 11, below]).
</p>
<p id="PC_52a">
What does not show up directly (the disease) can never <i>merely seem</i> to show up [in the secondary sense of
phenomenon: cf. the chart]. Besides symptoms, other examples of the “something else” through which a thing might
appear include symbols, indications, and so on.
