<b>7. <i>Appearance-3: that through which something else indirectly appears.</i></b> A symptom, such as a
rash, certainly does show up as what it is, namely as a rash. But the rash <i>indicates something else</i>
connected with it: a physical disorder that is actually present in the body but does not show up
directly. To the degree that it is a symptom, the rash is not a phenomenon in the genuine sense (an
appearance-1): it does not show <i>itself</i> so much as it indicates something else.
<br/>
A symptom is an appearance-3 and, like an appearance-2, has to do with a not-showing-up. 
However, with an appearance-3 the “not”<span style="color:magenta;" title="in this case. [in diesem Falle. GA 2: 39 n.
“a”].">☞</span> doesn't have the privative sense associated with a
mere semblance (appearance-2) for two reasons:
<br/>
1. A symptom neither hides the disease nor deprives the disease of any appearance at
all. On the contrary, it manifests the disease.
<br/>
2. A disease cannot show up directly as the disease it is; it always shows up only
through symptoms.
<br/>
In addition to symptoms, other examples of appearance-3 include symbols, indications, depictions,
and the like.<span style="color:magenta;" title="See SZ § 17, ¶ 5 and Figure 17.3">◊</span> All these are species of the genus “something by means of which something else
appears,” but they are, of course, separated by their specific differences [cf. Figure 1.1].
