<b>8. <i>Ex-sistence as temporality.</i></b> I argue that temporality is what finally accounts for our way of being. To confirm that
thesis, SZ I.2. chapter 4 will reinterpret the structures of ex-sistence that have been laid out in SZ I.1, but now in
terms of temporality. However, that will not yet constitute an answer to our main question about what accounts for
the intelligibility of being in general,<sup>¶</sup> but it will have prepared the ground for such an answer.

¶ 8, being in general: καϑόλου, καϑ’ αὑτό [i.e., universally; in itself]. [Ed. Here “being” h refers above all to the
being of non-ex-sistential things: von Herrmann, Hermeneutische Phänomenologie, I, 179.14-16.]
