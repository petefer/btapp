<b>8. <i>The focus is on the job to be done.</i></b>
In using something, I don’t understand it theoretically at all, nor am I explicitly
aware of my foresight into its purpose. In order for me to actually use a tool, its explicit “toolness” has to recede from
sight. In using it, I don’t focus directly on the tool, much less on its toolness; instead, I am absorbed in the job to be
done. And the job itself has <i>its</i> usefulness: it, too, is for a purpose. In fact, the job entails the whole set of referrals
(e.g., tool-referred-to-task) that lets me understand this thing <i>as</i> a tool.
