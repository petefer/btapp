<b>1. <i>The question has been forgotten.</i></b>
<span title="At SZ 8d Heidegger summarizes: the question of being (1) has
venerable origins, (2) but lacks an answer, and (3) even a proper formulation.">◊</span>
Today, there’s a renewed interest in metaphysics, but without a real
“struggle” like what Theatetus called a “war of the giants over being.”
<span title="At Sophist 246a4-5 the Eleatic Stranger tells Theaetetus that there
appears to be a war of giants going on about the nature of being [γιγαντομαχία περί τῆς οὐσίας]. The
γιγαντομαχία / gigantomachia refers to the mythological war of the giants vs. the Olympian gods mentioned
by Xenophanes (ca. 540 BCE; frag. 1, line 21) and Pindar (fl. ca. 450 BCE), Nemean Ode 1, 65-67, etc.">◊</span>
This utterly important question
stimulated the work of Plato and Aristotle but then subsided from serious consideration, only to reemerge
once again in Hegel’s <i>Logic</i>. However, what Plato and Aristotle wrested from the phenomena has been
trivialized.
