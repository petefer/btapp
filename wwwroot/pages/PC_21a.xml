<b>1. <i>The question has been forgotten.</i></b><sup>n</sup> Today, there’s a renewed interest in metaphysics, but without a real
“struggle” over the question: a γιγαντομαχία περί τῆς οὐσίας [<i>Sophist</i> 246a4-5].<sup>n</sup> This utterly important
question stimulated the work of Plato and Aristotle but then subsided from serious consideration, only to
reemerge once more in Hegel’s <i>Logic</i>. However, what Plato and Aristotle wrested from the phenomena has
been trivialized.
