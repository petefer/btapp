        Some of the following terminology that will be explained more fully later in § 44:
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left:2em;">
        • <i>alētheia</i>-1 = ex-sistence as the sphere of intelligibility, the so-called “clearing”;
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left:2em;">
        • <i>alētheia</i>-2 = the intelligibility of something when taken as this or that, whether correctly or not;
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left:2em;">
        • <i>alētheia</i>-3 = the truth of a correct statement.

We said that the first function of logos
is to make sense of something, whether correctly or not, by drawing the meaning from the way the
thing itself shows up rather than from my feelings or wishes about the thing. Given this apophantic/
de-clarative function, a <i>logos</i> can have the structure of a <i>synthesis</i>—not, however, in the
sense of synthesizing “things out there” with “ideas in here” (my “inner mental states”), where the
problem then becomes how “interior” mental states can agree with “exterior” physical objects.
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Greek word <i>synthesis</i> is made up of two elements: <i>-thesis</i>, placing something, and <i>syn</i>,
together with something else. In the case of logos as <i>synthesis</i>, the <i>syn-</i> has a purely
apophantic/declarative function: someone claims, whether correctly or not, that S (a certain thing)
is to be synthesized with and understood in terms of P (a meaning drawn from the thing as it
appears).
