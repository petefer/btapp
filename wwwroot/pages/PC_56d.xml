<b>19. <i>λόγος as ἀλήθεια-2.</i></b> Λόγος, as just letting a thing be seen-<i>as-something</i>, can be ἀληθής—but by that we do not
mean ἀλήθεια in the derived sense of truth as the correspondence of S and P. Λόγος = ἀληθεύειν aka ἀποϕαίνεσθαι:
taking the thing we are talking about <i>out of</i> [ἀ-] “hiddenness” [-ληθ-] and letting it be seen as “un-hidden” (ἀληθής)—in
short, dis-covering it. The verb ψεύδεσθαι means: to cover something up, to put it forth as what it is not.
