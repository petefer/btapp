<b>18. <i>Logos qua sunthesis: letting something be seen-as.</i></b> The function of <i>logos</i> as <i>apo-phansis</i> [de-claration] is to
declare the meaning of something by pointing-it-out-<i>as</i>-this-or-that. Because of this, <i>logos</i> can have the structure of
sunthesis. Such σύνϑεσις is not a matter of combining ideas (“inner mental states”) with things, where the problem
then becomes how such mental states “inside” might agree with physical states “outside.” Here the <i>sun</i>- [“with”] of
<i>sunthesis</i> has a purely apo-phantic [de-clarative/showing] function: it means letting X [the thing] be seen in its
<i>togetherness</i> with Y, letting X be seen as <i>something</i>.
