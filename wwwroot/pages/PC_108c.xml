<b>4. <i>Relations ➜ referrals ➜ indications.</i></b>
As indications, signs are a subset of referrals, and referrals in turn are a subset
of relations—but all of this only in the <i>most universal-formal</i> sense. Therefore, saying that a sign “is a relation” is of
no help here. In fact, we will eventually have to show that “relations,” precisely because of their universal-formal
character, have the source of their being in referrals.
