<b>4. <i>Letting a tool be suitable: two senses of the term.</i></b>
“Letting something be suitable for use” can be taken in two ways,
either as a posteriori/ontical or as a priori/ontological.
<br/>
4.1 The everyday ontical sense of “letting something be suitable” is that I simply let it be,
    <span title="Letting-be. Cf.
“On the Essence of Truth,” where “letting be” is used in principle and very broadly for every kind of thing! [German:
Das Seyn-lassen. Vgl. “Vom Wesen der Wahrheit”, wo das Sein-lassen grundsätzlich und ganz weit für jegliches
Seiende!] [See Editor’s note. * ]">☞</span>
     i.e., I <i>use</i> it as a tool,
as a means to the end that it can serve.
<br/>
<b>4.2</b> However, underlying that everyday ontical use of a tool, and making it possible, there is an a priori ontological
fact at work, which we have been referring to as the “freeing up beforehand” of tools within a world of praxis.
<br/>
Such “freeing up” does not mean producing the tool, bringing it into being for the first time. Rather, it means the
<i>prior disclosing</i> of things (which already exist) as <i>being</i> useful.
<span title="and thus such
disclosure lets them be meaningfully present. [German: Also in seiner Wahrheit wesen lassen.] [See Editor’s note.
* ]">☞</span>
This state of affairs of “letting things be suitable for
use” has to be <i>already operative</i> if I am to encounter anything at all as a tool. It comes with the very structure of any
world of praxis—any world of means-to-ends suitability—regardless of whether a specific something is actually used
for a task or not. Even when I find that a tool is not usable, it is still within my field of concern, whether I choose to
work on it, repair it, or just throw it away.
