<b>11. <i>SZ II.1: Kant’s twofold failure.</i></b> Using ur-temporality as the clue, SZ II.1 will interpret Kant’s chapter on
schematism and his doctrine of time. We will show that he was unable to envision ur-temporality because (1) he
neglected the problem of being and, in connection with that, (2) he failed to provide a thematic ontology of ex-sistence
(or, in Kant’s terms, of the subjectivity of the subject).

<p id="PC_45b">
Instead, (1) Kant took over dogmatically Descartes’ positions (even where he had surpassed them); and (2) he
stayed with the traditional notion of time (“one now-moment after another”) even as he relocated time within the
subject. Hence he failed to work out a transcendental determination of the structure and function of time. Kant stayed
with the tradition on these two issues—subjectivity and time—and thus never even saw the problem of how the “I
think” and time are connected.
