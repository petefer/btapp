<b>¶ 1 Topic: Historicity is based on care and temporality SZ
<br/>
<i>A. Thesis</i><br/>
1. I can existentielly have a “history” only because I existentially am historical.<br/>
2. We will justify this thesis by showing that the ontological problem of history is an existential one.<br/>
<i>B. Procedure</i><br/>
3. The being of ex-sistence is care.<br/>
4. Care is grounded in temporality.<br/>
5. We will examine temporality to find historical living and historicity, <br/>
6. and will show historicity to be an extension of temporality. <br/>
<i>C. Authentic temporality, authentic historicity</i><br/>
7. Authentic temporality is “living mortally” by resolutely anticipating one’s death.<br/>
8. Question: Does authentic temporality entail authentically living one’s history?
