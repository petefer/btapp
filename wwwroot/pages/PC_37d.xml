<b>5. <i>Our first task: an ex-sistential analysis of ex-sistence.</i></b> Our interpretation of ex-sistence develops and decays
according to how we ex-sist; moreover, there are many ex-sistentiel perspectives on ex-sistence: philosophical
psychology, anthropology, ethics, political science, poetry, biography, history, and so on. These perspectives may
have an immediate ex-sistentiel-personal purchase on us, but they fail to reach our basic ex-sistentiality.
<br/>
Ex-sistentiel and ex-sistential analyses are not mutually exclusive, but they do not coincide. If we grant that
philosophical knowledge is possible and necessary, then ex-sistentiel interpretations can require ex-sistential
analyses. Only when SZ I.3 works out the complete structure of ex-sistence will the gains of SZ I.1 and I.2 get their
adequate ex-sistential justification.
