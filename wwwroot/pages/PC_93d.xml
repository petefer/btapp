<b>11. <i>No. 3: any ex-sistentiel-personal world of meaning.</i></b> A world of <i>meaning</i>—an exclusively human phenomenon—
is ontic (it is a thing), but it is an <i>ex-sistentiel</i> thing, something that only <i>persons</i> live in. Such an ontic-ex-sistentiel
world can be <i>private</i> (e.g., your family, a specific set of interests you have, etc.) or <i>social</i> (the communities—
economic, political, and so on—that you inhabit.
