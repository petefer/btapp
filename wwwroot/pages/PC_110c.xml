<b>9. <i>What signs do.</i></b>
The turn-signal does two things: (1) It appears as <i>something useful</i>, and (2) it brings into view a
<i>whole context</i> (the intersection and what’s happening there) in such a way that I can use foresight to <i>orient myself</i>
within that context. In other words, the turn-signal does more than indicate the car’s upcoming left turn. It brings into
view an <i>ensemble of things</i> that I can employ my foresight to use and do. It lets me actually see and understand 
<i>the practical meaning of things in the intersection</i>.
<br/>
The same goes for “future-oriented” signs, e.g., the symptoms of a coming disease or a drop in the barometer.
These show “what’s coming” (an outbreak of the flu, a storm on the horizon), but they show it not as something
“added on” to objectively present things (one’s body in first case, one’s neighborhood in the second). Rather, the flu
or the storm are things we expect (or didn’t expect) while we were busy with other things.
<br/>
Likewise with signs of what has already happened (e.g., the fever abates as a sign the flu has passed; the barometer
going back to normal, indicating the storm is over): it’s our <i>concern with</i>, our <i>interest in</i>, what has happened that
understands these signs.
<br/>
The same with bookmarks: they remind us “our place” in the novel we’re reading. — In fact <i>all</i> signs are
indications of “where we are” in our lived worlds of meaning: what we’re involved in and how it’s important to us.
