<b>4. <i>Our “essence” is ex-sistence: having to become our own being.</i></b> The being<sup>¶</sup> to which<sup>¶</sup> I can and in fact
always do relate to in one way or another is what we call <i>Existenz</i>.<sup>n</sup> We are not a “what” [i.e., we do not have an “essence” in the
traditional sense]. Rather, our “essence,” our inevitable way of being, consists in ex-sisting, i.e.,
<i>having to become our being as our own</i>. We are ex-sistence [<i>Dasein</i>], which expresses the fact that our being is ours
to become.
