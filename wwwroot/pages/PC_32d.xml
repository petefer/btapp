<span title="• The one technical term that I leave in the German throughout this text is “Existenz.” @ The word
refers to the being (Sein: the way-of-being) of human beings. At SZ 42.16 (§ 9, ¶ 3) Heidegger will
call Existenz the “Wesen” of human being, but in the sense of how-we-are-and-cannot-not-be rather
than in the usual sense of “essence” (whatness).
• The term “Dasein” refers to the entity (the person) who has Existenz as his or her way of being.
Hence the term “Dasein” includes the notion of “having Existenz, and the two terms are often
overlap in SZ. The fundamental ontic characteristic of human being is that we are ontological, i.e.,
have a pre-theoretical understanding of being.
• At GA 29/30: 432.33-35 = 299.5-8 Heidegger defines Existenz as one’s structural relating to things
in their being in such a way that this relating co-constitutes one’s own way of being.">◊</span>
 We are not a “what” [i.e., we do not have an “essence” in the
traditional sense]. Rather, our “essence,” our inevitable way of being, consists in ex-sisting, i.e.,
<i>having to become our being as our own</i>.
<span title="[German: daß es je sein Sein als seiniges zu sein hat.] This
issue is taken up in § 9. See Heidegger’s marginal note there to ¶ 2, Zu-sein and the Editor’s note there to
the same term.">◊</span>
We are ex-sistence [<i>Dasein</i>], which expresses the fact that our being is ours
to become.
