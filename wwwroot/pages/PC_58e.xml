<b>25. <i>Phenomenology: a descriptive method without a predetermined subject matter.</i></b> The word
“phenomenology” does not parallel “<i>theo</i>-logy, <i>socio</i>-logy,” etc., terms that designate the subject
matter of the study (in those cases: God, society, etc.). “Phenomenology” designates not a specific
subject matter but a <i>method</i>, a general way of treating that subject matter. A science “of”
phenomena is one that explains its subject matter exclusively by directly describing and spelling
it out—as in the phrase “descriptive phenomenology,” which in fact is a tautology. Here the verb
“to describe” points to a prohibition. It warns us not to decide or define anything without first
describing it thoroughly just as it appears to us. Description is a form of <i>logos</i>. It is a direct, first-person
<i>experiential</i> description of the content of what we encounter and seek to define. In its
ordinary and formal sense, “phenomenology” means just that: describing something exactly the
way it appears as itself.<span style="color:magenta;" title="This, of course, leaves open the question of whether one takes what appears correctly or not.">◊</span>
