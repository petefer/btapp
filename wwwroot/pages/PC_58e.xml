<b>25. <i>Phenomenology: a descriptive method rather than a subject matter.</i></b> “Phenomeno-logy” does not parallel “theology,
socio-logy,” etc., which designate the <i>objects</i> of their study (viz., God, society, etc.). “Phenomenology” designates
not a “what” but a “how,” not some subject matter but a way of treating it, viz., <i>directly</i> showing and demonstrating
whatever the investigation is about—as in the phrase “descriptive phenomenology” (which in fact is a tautology). In
this case, to describe is a <i>prohibition</i>. It says: Characterize nothing without first demonstrating it <i>experientially</i>.
Description <i>qua</i> λόγος means getting to the core [of the experience], encountering a thing experientially in such a way
as eventually to give it a scientific determination. Formally (and ordinarily) speaking, “phenomenology” pertains to
exhibiting a thing just as it shows up in itself.
