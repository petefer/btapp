<b>¶ 11 Summation of the whole of §74</b>
<br/>
<i>A. Resolve and Schicksal</i><br/>
1. <i>Schicksal</i>is resolve, that is: resolute anticipation of my death as freeing me for existentiel insight into the present situation.<br/> 
<i>B. Schicksal and Ge-schick</i><br/>
2. Individual <i>Schicksal</i> is the basis for communal <i>Ge-schick</i>, that is, for living a communal history with others.<br/> 
<i>C. Retrieval</i><br/>
3. Acts of retrieval let me see explicitly that both <i>Schicksal</i> and <i>Ge-schick</i> are bound up with our received-and-still-available legacy of possibilities.<br/>
4. Acts of retrieval are what first show me my own history.<br/> 
<i>D. Temporality as the basis</i><br/>
5. Temporality as ex-static openness is the existential basis<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;for living historically,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;for the disclosedness that goes with that<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;for the appropriation of that disclosedness.<br/>
