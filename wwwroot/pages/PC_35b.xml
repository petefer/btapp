<b>13. <i>Fundamental ontology simply gets to the root of our pre-theoretical understanding of being.</i></b> Our
question is “What accounts for the intelligibility of being?” But ex-sistence is always already related to and
understands being. Therefore, our fundamental question about being simply <i>radicalizes</i>—gets to the root
of—ex-sistence’s pre-theoretical understanding of being.
