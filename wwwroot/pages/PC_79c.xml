<b>7. <i>The “in” of being “in” the world of meaning is not spatial.</i></b>
<span title="SZ 188d calls this paragraph a preliminary indication of “being-in” as
“familiarity with.”">◊</span>
 The “in” here does not refer to being “inside”
something, like water in a glass or the coat in the closest, where the glass and the coat, in turn, each are in a
certain spatial location “in the room, in the house,” and so on, right up to “in the universe.” That applies only
to things that are objectively present “within” a location along with other objectively present things. These are
categorial characteristics: they belong to non-ex-sistent things.
