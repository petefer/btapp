<b>4. <i>This section: only the preliminary concept of phenomenology.</i></b> Phenomenology’s maxim—“Get to the things
themselves!”—is set over against<br />
 • ungrounded constructions<br />
 • accidental findings<br />
 • adopting undemonstrated concepts<br />
 • pseudo-questions that have long paraded as “problems.”<br />
But insofar as this maxim is the self-evident principle of <i>all</i> science, how does it become an explicit title for
<i>phenomenological</i> research? We need to investigate this “self-evident” principle in order to clarify our procedure.
What follows is only the preliminary concept of phenomenology.
