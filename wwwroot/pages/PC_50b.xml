<b>4. <i>This section: only the preliminary concept of phenomenology.</i></b> Phenomenology’s maxim—
“Stick with the things as you encounter them”—means: Focus directly on what you experience in
terms of how you experience it. That approach is set over against<br />
 • constructing ideas out of thin air<br />
 • “discovering” things by sheer accident<br />
 • adopting unproven notions<br />
 • chasing after pseudo-questions that have long paraded as “philosophical problems.”Focusing on one’s experience is (or should be) the self-evident principle of all science. Then how
does it come to be a specific maxim for phenomenological research? In phenomenology we are
dealing with issues that in fact are “self-evident,” and we want to stay as close to these issues as
possible. In explaining our method, this section will offer only the preliminary concept of
phenomenology.
