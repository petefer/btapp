<b>¶ 6 <i>Schicksal</i> (individual) and <i>Ge-schick</i> (communal)</b>
<br/>
<i>A. Schicksal</i><br/>
1. In resolve I let death become powerful in me. But in the choice to take over the <i>powerlessness</i> of my thrownness I gain the <i>superior power</i> of finite freedom and get an insight into what may happen in the now disclosed situation.<br/>
<i>B. Ge-schick</i><br/>
2. As historical-<i>schicksalhaft</i>, I am also in-the-world-with-others. Thus my Geschehen is also a co-Geschehen, i.e., a <i>Ge-schick</i>.<br/>
3. A <i>Ge-schick</i> is the living of a common history by a community, a people.<sup>19</sup><br/>
4. A <i>Ge-schick</i> isn’t the sum total of individual <i>Schicksals</i> (just as social existence isn’t the gluing together of individual subjects).<br/>
5. Rather, our individual <i>Schicksals</i> are already guided by our social existence: our living together in the same world of meaning and choosing certain possibilities together.<br/>
6. The <i>Ge-schick</i> of a community gets freed up only as we communicate with one another and struggle together.<br/>
<i>C. Schicksal and Ge-schick together</i><br/>
7. The full, authentic living of one’s history is made up of the individual-communal <i>schicksalhaft Ge-schick</i> in and with my “generation” (in Dilthey’s sense).<sup>20</sup>
