<b>17. <i>Towards the next section.</i></b> Our engagement with meaning—our being “in” the world of meaning—is thus
reduced to the single model of <i>theoretical knowledge of objects</i>. This constrained view is adopted not only in
epistemology but also for practical (i.e., non-theoretical) behavior. It hides the closest and most natural way we
are engaged with meaning. In the following section we will discuss the <i>ex-sistential</i> mode of that engagement.
