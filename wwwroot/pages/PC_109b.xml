<b>6. <i>Some factors operative in a turn-signal.</i></b>
Take the example of an automobile’s turn-signal, a “tool” that the driver
makes use of. Some of the factors operative in its use are:
<br/>
• the concern: safety—that of the driver, the passengers, and any pedestrians
<br/>
• the context: driving; other cars on the road; the relevant traffic laws
<br/>
• its purpose: It indicates (refers to) the direction of the turn.
<br/>
• its structure: It serves the purpose of alerting others to the turn.
<br/>
The turn-signal, as a sign, indicates something, and this is a form of referral. However, the element of referring-byindicating
does not itself constitute the being of the turn-signal.
<br/>
<b>7. <i>Two kinds of serviceability.</i></b>
A sign is a kind of tool, i.e., it is useful for something. Generally speaking, it has the
same being as any tool, namely, serviceability: it serves some purpose. (We recall that the being of all tools is
categorial, not ex-sistential). But what is the specific kind of being that pertains to signs as contrasted with tools such
as hammers?
<br/>
The <i>purpose</i> of a tool determines <i>what kind</i> of tool it is. The purpose of a hammer is to pound in nails. The purpose
of a sign is <i>to indicate something</i>, e.g., “Here is where to wait for the bus.”
<br/>
<b><i>The special character of signs.</i></b> Moreover, a sign has its own peculiar relation (1) to the ensemble of useful things
in a given world of meaning and (2) to the “worldly character” of those things, i.e., their <i>way of being</i> within the world
of meaning. But signs are a <i>very special kind</i> of tool that we use in our practical dealings. What is the basis of this
special character?
