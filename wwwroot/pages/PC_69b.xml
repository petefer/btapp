<b>7. <i>Everydayness as “the normal.”</i></b>
As an entity that ex-sists, I necessarily <i>am</i> possibility and somehow <i>understand</i>
myself as possibility.
<span style="color:magenta;" title="GA 2: 58.23 adds (after “und”) “d. h. zugleich”
(“that is to say, at the same time”).">◊</span>
Those two elements constitute what we mean by <i>Existenz</i>. Therefore, an ontological
interpretation of our being<span title="It would be better to say: of our understanding of being. [German: besser: seines
Seinsverständnises.]">☞</span> entails unfolding the ex-sistential nature of <i>Existenz</i>. But we do not start with an idea of
<i>Existenz</i> and work from there; instead, we want to meet up with <i>Existenz</i> just the way it shows up in the closest and
most usual place: the everyday. Everydayness is a very positive element of how we are.
<span style="color:magenta;" title="See SZ 129b, where Heidegger speaks of the crowd (das Man as “sociality”)
as a positive element constituting the being of ex-sistence.">◊</span>
<i>Existenz</i> arises from it and
returns to it. We may call it our “normal,” run-of-the-mill way of ex-sisting.
