<b>6. <i>Such tools show two elements of themselves.</i></b>
These three ways that a tool can “stand out” as unusable reveal (1)
an element of objective presence, but (2) in something useful I don’t notice that by way of detached observation, nor
does the tool show up as “just a thing.” Instead, the objective presence shows up <i>in conjunction</i> with the usefulness
of the tool. I do want to get the fridge <i>out of the way</i>--but it’s still <i>something useful</i> that I want to get out of the way.
