<b>10. <i>The same can happen when a tool is missing.</i></b>
Say I find that a hammer—one that I had not been focusing on but
was simply taking for granted—turns up missing. That marks a break in the referrals that my practical foresight had
been envisioning. My foresight now comes up with ... <i>nothing</i>. At that very point I come to see both (1) the set of
tools that the missing hammer was part of and (2) the task I was going to use the hammer for. The world of meaning
I’ve been involved in suddenly lights up—not as a “thing” and much less as an objectively present foundation for
tools, but rather as a region of intelligibility.

As long my practical foresight was at work, that world of meaning was also operating, referring tools to tasks.
However, I hadn’t noticed it because I was focused on <i>things</i>; nonetheless I was tacitly presuming it. However, when
I found the hammer missing, the whole set of referrals suddenly got disclosed.

(N.B. In what follows, “disclosed” and “disclosedness” will be used as technical terms referring to the fact that
something has been “opened up to understanding.” As we use it, “to disclose” will never have the sense of “to infer
from” or “discover via inference.”)
