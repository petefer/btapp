<b>14. <i>Summation and further questions</i></b>
<br/>
• Engagement with meaning is an implicit (“non-thematic”), foresightful absorption in a set of references that
constitute the usefulness of a group of tools.<br/>
• I can care about things only because I am already familiar with a world of practical meaning.<br/>
• I can become so intensely absorbed in something that I get lost in my fascination with it.<br/>
Nonetheless, questions remain:<br/>
• What exactly is this world of meaning that I am already familiar with?<br/>
• How is it that a thing’s worldly character (the fact that it is within meaning) can “light up”?<br/>
• What precisely is the referential structure that gets disrupted such that the objective presence of things “stands
out”?</p>
