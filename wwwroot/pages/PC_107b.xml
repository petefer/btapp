<b>14. <i>Summation and further questions</i></b>
</p>
<p id="PC_107b">• Engagement with meaning is an implicit (“non-thematic”), foresightful absorption in a set of references that
constitute the usefulness of a group of tools.</p>
<p id="PC_107b">• I can care about things only because I am already familiar with a world of practical meaning.</p>
<p id="PC_107b">• I can become so intensely absorbed in something that I get lost in my fascination with it.</p>
<p id="PC_107b" class="noindent">Nonetheless, questions remain:</p>
<p id="PC_107b">• What exactly is this world of meaning that I am already familiar with?</p>
<p id="PC_107b">• How is it that a thing’s worldly character (the fact that it is within meaning) can “light up”?</p>
<p id="PC_107b">• What precisely is the referential structure that gets disrupted such that the objective presence of things “stands
out”?</p>
