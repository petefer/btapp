<b>4. <i>Ex-sistence entails an implicit understanding of being.</i></b> If the thing being sought—in this case, the
intelligibility of being—guides our search for it, it must be somehow already available to us. Above [at SZ
3b] we hinted that we always already understand being. Starting from that base we raise the question “What
makes that possible?” Even if we do not yet know what the word “being” means, we do have an implicit,
pre-conceptual sense of what “is” (and thus “being”) signifies. <i>That pre-conceptual sense remains a fact</i>
even if we haven’t yet got the framework for understanding what makes being intelligible.
