<b>3. <i>Tools are referred (1) to tasks and (2) to ex-sistence as the final purpose.</i></b>
Suitability, which is cognate with
serviceability, usefulness, and referredness, is the being of tools. It is what makes something be a tool once it has been
“freed up.” This is an ontological, not an ontic, matter.
