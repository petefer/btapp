<b>3. <i>Tools are referred (1) to tasks and (2) to ex-sistence as the final purpose.</i></b>
Suitability, which is cognate with
serviceability, usefulness, and referredness, is the being of tools. It is what makes something be a tool once it has been
“freed up.” This is an ontological, not an ontic, matter.<br/>
Such suitability occurs as a concatenation of relations. The hammer is suitable for hammering nails. ➜ The nails
are suitable for holding boards together. ➜ Nailing boards together is a suitable way to put up a roof . . . ➜ all of
which is <i>for the sake of</i> a need and/or possibility of ex-sistence as the final purpose.<br/>
<i>What</i> the tool is suitable <i>for</i> can be seen from the whole world of work. That work-world is what “lends” the tool
its status as useful, and thus it is prior to the tool. (The world of camping-in-the-woods “lends” a random rock its
usefulness for pounding in tent pegs, and thus the world of camping-in-the-woods is prior to the stone-as-ersatzmallet.)<br/>
The final reason that gathers the chain of suitabilities together is not a thing, not even a <i>useful</i> thing. Rather, it is
a human purpose befitting ex-sistence as engagement with the world of meaning. Ex-sistence, as always concerned
for itself, is <i>that for the sake of which</i> the suitabilities finally function.<br/>
We will leave it at that for the moment and focus first of all on what it means to let a tool be suitable for a task.
That will lead to a definition of the essence of all worlds of praxis.
