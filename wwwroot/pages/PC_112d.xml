<b>14. <i>Signs in so-called “primitive” cultures.</i></b>
In cultures imbued with magic and fetishism, people take things as signs
in a somewhat “immediate” engagement with meaning and without purely theoretical intent or speculation. Trying to
interpret magic and fetishism with some general idea of “the sign” fails to capture how signs function in that context.
</p>
<p id="PC_112d">
In such cultures the <i>sign</i> and <i>what it indicates</i> coincide. The sign can take the place of, and even <i>be</i>, what it
indicates. But this coinciding does not mean that the sign has been “objectified,” because neither the sign nor what it
indicates are understood as two separate “objects” that could then become “identical.” There is no “objectification”
here at all. Rather, the sign has not yet become free, detached from what it is about: it is still tightly bound up with its
“aboutness.”
</p>

This means that a sign used in fetishism or magic is not yet understood as a sign in the strict sense. It is certainly
something that one <i>deals</i> with, but it is not a “tool,” a means to a separate end. In fact, it is possible that these categories
(“tool” and “useful”) are just as inadequate as “thinghood” for understanding the being of signs in such cultures. And
yet those people <i>do</i> have an understanding of being. That only heightens the need to work out the “formal” definition
of a world of meaning. (And the definition must be broad enough and flexible enough that when we say that a thing
within a given world of meaning is “not yet X” or “no longer Y,” those <i>negative</i> statements will help us to see <i>positively</i>
what the thing is.)
