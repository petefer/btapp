<b>11. <i>Traditional philosophy glimpsed the ontic-ontological priority of human being.</i></b> Early on,
philosophers did see the ontic-ontological priority of ex-sistence but did not grasp or problematize it. For
example:<br />
  • Parmenides [frag. 3: νοεῖν and εἶναι “go together.”]<br />
  • Aristotle: ἡ ψυχὴ τὰ ὄντα πώς ἐστι πάντα.<sup>1</sup> “Man’s
being is somehow all things.”<sup>n</sup> That is, ψυχή (man’s being) has αἴσθησις (sensation), which
discovers data, and νόησις (mind), which discovers the <i>being</i> of things: what and that they <i>are</i>.<br />
  • Thomas Aquinas: In his work the ontic-ontological priority of human being over things emerges
but is not clarified. He worked out the “transcendentals” (<i>transcendentia</i>), i.e., the most basic,
trans-generic characteristics of things, characteristics that lie beyond any <i>modus specialis entis</i> [=
beyond all species and genera of things]. One of those transcendental characteristics is <i>verum</i> [the
intrinsic openness of things to the understanding]. He demonstrated this via the nature of the soul,
which is ens quod natum est convenire cum omni ente, i.e., a thing that by its very nature “comes
together with”<sup>n</sup> all other things, but Aquinas did not clarify this.<sup>2</sup><br />
Obviously, all of this has nothing to do with “subjectivizing” everything.

somewhat more robust “deduction” of the transcendentals that deviates from the <i>De veritate</i>. [Ed. That work
