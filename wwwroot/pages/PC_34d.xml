<b>11. <i>Traditional philosophy glimpsed the ontic-ontological priority of human being.</i></b> Early on,
philosophers did see the ontic-ontological priority of ex-sistence but did not grasp or problematize it. For
example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;• Parmenides [frag. 3: νοεῖν and εἶναι “go together.”]<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;• Aristotle: ἡ ψυχὴ τὰ ὄντα πώς ἐστι πάντα (<i>De Anima</i> III 8, 431b21; cf. III 5, 430a14ff.): “Man’s
being is somehow all things.”n That is, ψυχή (man’s being) has αἴσϑησις/sensation, which
discovers data, and νόησις/mind, which discovers the <i>being</i> of things (= what and that they <i>are</i>).<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;• Thomas Aquinas: In his work the ontic-ontological priority of human being over things emerges
but is not clarified. He worked out the “transcendentals” (<i>transcendentia</i>), i.e., the most basic,
trans-generic characteristics of things, characteristics that lie beyond any <i>modus specialis entis</i> [=
beyond all species and genera of things]. One of those transcendental characteristics is verum [the
intrinsic openness of things to the understanding]. He demonstrated this via the nature of the soul,
which is ens quod natum est convenire cum omni ente, i.e., a thing that by its very nature “comes
together with”<sup>n</sup> all other things, but Aquinas did not clarify this.<sup>16</sup><br />
Obviously, all of this has nothing to do with “subjectivizing” everything.
