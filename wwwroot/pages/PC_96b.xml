<b>3. <i>Two wrong approaches to what we first encounter.</i></b>
Some might say: “Just start with “things.” But this assumes
that the being we are after is “thing-ness,” i.e., substantiality, materiality, extendedness, and so on. But that very
assumption obscures the kind of things that practical dealings actually deal with. So, should we start with the things
we “invest with value”? But then what is the being of “value,” “investing,” and so on? Both these approaches miss
the objects of practical concern.
