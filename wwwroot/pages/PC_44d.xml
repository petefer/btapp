<b>9. <i>The limitations of this destruction.</i></b> The destruction of the history of ontology [in SZ II] aims at, and is possible only
within, the formulation of the question of what accounts for being, which is our first goal [= SZ I.3]. We will carry out
the destruction only with regard to the decisive stages in the history of that question.
