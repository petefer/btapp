<b>2. <i>Historicity makes possible the science of history.</i></b> Whereas historicity as an ex-sistential structure may often remain
hidden, the <i>science</i> of history works at discovering, studying, and preserving what tradition has passed on to us. But
note: the <i>science</i> of history is an <i>ontic</i> inquiry. It is based on, made possible by, and therefore presumes ex-sistential
historicity.

<p id="PC_41c">
On the one hand, as long as our historicity remains hidden, we cannot [properly] discover history or carry out
historical research. But on the other hand, even peoples that lack a science of history still have historicity as the
structure of their ex-sistence. A culture can <i>lack</i> a science of history only because ex-sistence itself <i>is</i> historical
[<i>geschichtlich</i>].
