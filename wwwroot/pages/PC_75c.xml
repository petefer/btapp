<b>10. <i>Psychology and biology likewise overlook the being of man.</i></b> Psychological and anthropological theories of
human being also lack ontological foundations; nor can that be remedied by combining them into a general
biology. As a <i>“life</i> science” biology is finally founded on the being of ex-sistence. Biology’s focus is exclusively
on “life”—however, life is not something objectively present, nor is it equivalent to ex-sistence. In turn, exsistence
is not some ontologically undefined “life” plus something else.
