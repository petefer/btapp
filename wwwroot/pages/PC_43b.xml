<b>5. <i>Tradition usually conceals its transmission.</i></b> When tradition becomes dominant, it cloaks what it bequeaths to us
under the rubric of the “self-evident.” This blocks access to the original sources of its concepts and categories. Tradition
uproots our historicity while hiding the fact it has no ground to stand on. Hence, despite our interest in and efforts at
objectively correct history, we are blocked from positively returning to the past, appropriating it, and using it
productively.
