<b>¶ 4: Resolve described in three ways. <i>Schicksal</i> as authentic <i>Geschehen</i></b>
<br/>
<i>A. First way</i><br/>
1. I return to my mortal aheadness, open up an authentic possibility of ex-sistence from my <i>legacy</i>,<sup>18</sup> and <i>take</i> it over.<br/>
2. Hidden in the resolute return to thrownness is the <i>freeing up</i> of authentic possibilities (although I don’t necessarily see them <i>as</i> inherited).<br/>
3. The “good” is an ontological thesaurus, a legacy that empowers authentic ex-sistence, i.e., makes it possible.<br/>
Resolve is what frees up that legacy.<br/>
<i>B. Second way</i><br/>
4. Resolute anticipation of death—i.e., understanding myself as mortal—lets me find and choose an authentic possibility of ex-sistence unequivocally rather than accidentally.<br/>
5. Resolute anticipation of death drives out every accidental or provisional possibility.<br/>
<i>C. Third way</i><br/>
6. Becoming free <i>for</i> my death gives me my goal outright: it pushes me into my finitude.<br/>
7. That finitude pulls me back from taking the easy way out — remaining comfortable, indecisive, irresponsible — and brings me to the simplicity of my <i>Schicksal</i>.<br/>
<i>D. Summary: Schicksal is authentic Geschehen</i><br/>
8. <i>Schicksal</i> is living my history in authentic resoluteness, that is, freeing myself for myself in a possibility that was already there but that I have <i>chosen</i>.<br/>
