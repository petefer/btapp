<b>5. <i>Etymology of “phenomenology.” Division of this section.</i></b> “Phenomeno-logy” = ϕαινόμενον + λόγος—but this is not
to be taken superficially as “the science of phenomena.” We will examine each Greek word individually [in § 7 A and
B below] and then combine them [in § 7 C]. The history of the word itself (presumably from the school of Christian
Wolff [1679-1754]) is not important here.
