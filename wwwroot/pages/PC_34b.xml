<b>9. <i>Ex-sistence has priority over other things in three ways:</i></b><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <i>ontic</i>: As a thing among other things, we are unique: we are <i>Ex-sistenz</i>.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <i>ontological</i>: In turn, as ex-sistence we are onto-logical; that is, we have an understanding
of both our own being and the being of all non-ex-sistential things<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <i>ontic-ontological</i>: As (1) things that (2) understand being, we are the condition that makes
possible the science of ontology.<br />
Therefore, first and foremost we have to investigate ex-sistence’s way of being.
