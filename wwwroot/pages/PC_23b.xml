<b>5. <i>Second: “As the most universal, being is indefinable”—but it still remains a problem.</i></b><sup>2</sup> As far as it
goes, that is true: we cannot define “being” for the following reasons. We define things by first placing
them “under” (= within) a genus and then differentiating out the species of the thing.<sup>n</sup> But first of all, being
is not a thing; n and secondly it cannot be placed under a genus—i.e., it cannot be derived from or defined
in terms of anything higher—because there’s nothing higher that being. (Likewise it cannot be represented
by anything <i>lower</i> than itself). The upshot: “Being” [“<i>Sein</i>”] is not anything like a thing.<sup>3</sup>

Yet the “is” of things—their way of being—is still a problem to be solved. We’re simply saying that
being cannot be <i>a thing</i>. Therefore, it can’t be defined by way of a logic based on a traditional ontology that
applies only to <i>things</i> rather than to the “is” or way of <i>being</i> of things. So even though we cannot <i>define</i>
being, we still have to ask: What accounts for the fact that we can and do understand it?
