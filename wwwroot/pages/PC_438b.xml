<b>¶ 10 Summary of resolve, retrieval, <i>Schicksal</i>, historicity</b>
<br/>
<i>A. Resolve and retrieval</i><br/>
1. In resolve ex-sistence frees itself up as <i>Schicksal</i>.<br/> 
Retrieval is <i>explicit</i> resolve:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;in retrieval ex-sistence ex-sists <i>explicitly</i> as <i>Schicksal</i>.<br/>
<i>B. Existential Geschichte: rooted in aheadness (the “future”)</i><br/>
2. Ex-sistence is historicity/Schicksal, and existential Geschichte is rooted<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;not in the past<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;not in the present-in-connection-with-the-past<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;but in authentic historical living, which arises from one’s aheadness (“future”).<br/>
<i>C. Existential Geschichte and what-has-been-and-still-is</i><br/>
3. But as ahead-unto-death, ex-sistence is pushed back by death, to its own particular thrown situation.
This is what gives Gewesenheit its peculiar priority in the historical.<sup>25</sup>3. But as ahead-unto-death, ex-sistence is pushed back by death, SZ 386.16-21 = 438.13-17
to its own particular thrown situation.
This is what gives <i>Gewesenheit</i> its peculiar priority in the historical.25
<i>D. Finitude/mortality as the basis of historicity</i><br/>
4. Authentic finite temporality—living authentically as mortal—is the hidden basis of ex-sistence’s historicity.<br/>
<i>E. Historicity (not historiography) enables retrieval.</i><br/>
5. Retrieval is not what makes ex-sistence historical. Rather:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;as temporal, ex-sistence is historical,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and historicity makes possible retrieval, i.e., taking over one’s history.<br/>
6. For that, no science of history is required.<br/>
