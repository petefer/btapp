<b>38. <i>Re Husserl: possibility is higher than actuality.</i></b> This book would not be possible without Edmund Husserl,
especially his <i>Logical Investigations</i>, where phenomenology first emerged. Our preliminary concept of phenomenology
indicates that what is essential about phenomenology is not its <i>actuality</i> as a philosophical “movement.”
<span title="That is, not in line with the transcendental-philosophical trajectory of Kantian idealism.">☞</span> Higher than
actuality stands <i>possibility</i>. We can understand phenomenology <i>only</i> by seizing upon it as a possibility.<sup>1</sup>

<sup>1</sup> Any progress this book makes in opening up “the things themselves” is thanks to Edmund Husserl’s personal
guidance during my apprenticeship in Freiburg, including his generous sharing of unpublished manuscripts on
various areas of phenomenology.
