<b>38. <i>Re Husserl: possibility is higher than actuality.</i></b> 
This book would not be possible without Edmund Husserl,<span style="color:magenta;" title="
In all of SZ, and particularly in this section's discussion of phenomenology as a method, 
Heidegger makes no mention of the reductions that structure much of Husserl's methodology. 
However, in October of 1927, after he had just written a draft for some sections of Husserl's 
“Encyclopaedia Britannica Article,” Heidegger lectured on three moments in phenomenological 
method as a second-order thematic procedure (see GA 24: 29-31= 21-23):
• reduction: leading (-duction) the philosophical gaze “back” (re-) from its concentration
on an object to a focus on the significance (“being”) of that object within the
phenomenological correlation. For Husserl, that meant “back to” the transcendental
subject as constituting the meaning of the object. In Heidegger's paradigm, however,
where ex-sistence is thrown ahead as a self-transcending eject, the re-duction is a
matter of leading the thematic gaze ahead to the purpose or possibility that determines
the being/significance of the thing. Hence, Heidegger transforms the re-duction into an
in-duction, a “leading forward” (= Heidegger's recasting of Aristotle's epagōgē: cf.
GA 9: 244 = 187).
• construction: the explicit thematization of the being of an entity (cf. von Herrmann, II,
114.34-ff). This, however, has nothing to do with any “a-prioristic construction”: see
SZ § 10, n. 9.
• destruction: the dismantling of traditional concepts of being in order to get to their
source in the ex-sistential-temporal character of being.
In SZ, these moments correspond to, respectively, SZ I.1-2 (re-duction as in-duction), SZ I.3
(construction), and SZ II (destruction).">◊</span>
especially his <i>Logical Investigations</i>, the text in which phenomenology first
achieved a breakthrough. The preliminary concept of phenomenology that we have provided in
the present section shows that the essential thing about phenomenology is not its actuality as a
philosophical “movement.”
<span style="color:magenta;" title="That is: not in line with the
transcendental-philosophical trajectory of Kantian idealism. [d. h. nicht transzendentalphilosophische
Richtung des kritischen Kantischen Idealismus. GA 2: 51 n. “c”].">☞</span> Higher than
actuality stands <i>possibility</i>. Higher than actuality stands possibility. We can understand
phenomenology only by enacting it as a possibility.<sup>1</sup>

<sup>1</sup> Any progress this book makes in opening up “the things themselves” is thanks to Edmund Husserl's personal
guidance during my philosophical learning-years in Freiburg, including his generous
sharing of unpublished manuscripts on various areas of phenomenology.
