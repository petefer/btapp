<b>38. <i>Re Husserl: possibility is higher than actuality.</i></b> This book would not be possible without Edmund Husserl,
especially his <i>Logical Investigations</i>, where phenomenology first emerged. Our preliminary concept of phenomenology
indicates that what is essential about phenomenology is not its <i>actuality</i> as a philosophical “movement.”<sup>24</sup> Higher than
actuality stands <i>possibility</i>. We can understand phenomenology <i>only</i> by seizing upon it as a possibility.<sup>25</sup>
