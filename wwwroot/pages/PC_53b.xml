<b>9. <i>Thus far: three possible meanings of “appearance.”</i></b> These three must be kept distinct:<br />
 1. something that shows up indirectly through something else (e.g., a disease, which manifests itself indirectly
through a symptom);<br />
 2. that through which something else shows up indirectly while remaining hidden (e.g., the rash as manifesting a
hidden disease);<br />
 3. a phenomenon in the genuine sense of what-directly-shows-itself.<br />
