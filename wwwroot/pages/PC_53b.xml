<b>9. <i>Thus far: three possible meanings of “appearance.”</i></b> 
These three meanings must be kept distinct:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; appearance-1: a <i>genuine</i> appearance: a true phenomenon, something that appears
<i>directly</i> and <i>as itself</i>;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; • appearance-2: a <i>false or specious appearance</i>: a mere semblance, something that
appears as what it is not;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; • appearance-3: an appearance <i>through which</i> something else appears indirectly while
remaining hidden, i.e., not appearing on its own.
