<b>22. <i>How the other meanings of λόγος are derived.</i></b> (1) As letting something be perceived-<i>as</i>-something (cf.
<i>Vernehmen</i>), λόγος can come to mean reason [<i>Vernunft</i>]. (2) Because the λεγόμενον (the thing that is show-as) is a
ὑποκείμενον (an objectively present thing underlying the λόγος-procedure), λόγος <i>qua</i> λεγόμενον comes to mean the
<i>ratio</i>, the reason or grounds for, something. (3) Because λεγόμενον means X-seen-as-Y [and hence is a synthesis],
λόγος comes to mean relation or relationship.
