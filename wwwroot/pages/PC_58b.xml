<b>22. <i>How the other meanings of <i>logos</i> came about.</i></b> In ¶ 15 we noted the multiple meanings of
<i>logos</i> and the question of how they are derived from the single and more original meaning of the
term.
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; • <i>Logos</i> as the faculty of reason (<i>Vernunft</i>) derives from the first function of <i>logos</i>,
namely making sense of something by “bringing it before the mind” (<i>Vernehmen</i>)
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; • <i>Logos</i> as the “grounds” or reason for something evolved from the third and fourth
functions of <i>logos</i>. The object that an act of <i>logos</i> makes sense of is called the
<i>legomenon</i>, the “what's-being-made-sense-of.” In Greek that is the same as the
<i>hypokeimenon</i> (Latin, <i>subiectum</i>), the subject matter under consideration, represented
by the subject of a sentence. As the underlying subject matter “upon” which we place
a meaning, the <i>legomenon</i> came to be read as a “base” or “basis” and eventually as the
“ground/s” or reason for something, in Latin, the <i>ratio</i> of the thing.
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; • <i>Logos</i> as relation or relationship stems from the third and fourth functions of <i>logos</i>. We
make sense of an object, the <i>legomenon</i> or subject of the sentence, by taking it <i>as</i> this
or that, i.e., <i>relating</i> it to a certain meaning expressed by the predicate. From this
“relatedness” of the subject matter, <i>logos</i> comes to mean a relating or relationship
(<i>Beziehung, Verhältnis</i>).
