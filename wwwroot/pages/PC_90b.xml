<b>6. <i>Summation and prospects.</i></b> We have argued the following theses:<br />
• Our a priori engagement with meaning is the foundation for being able to know objects;<br />
• Our very being is to be engaged with meaning, and subject-object knowledge is only one form (and a
derivative one) of that fundamental engagement.<br />
• Subject-object knowledge has been taken as somehow independent of the engagement with meaning; and,
in the form of scientific knowledge, it has set itself up as the exemplar and guiding form of such engagement.<br />
• The engagement with meaning is not created by subject-object knowledge and does not derive from the
impact of things upon our senses.<br />
Given that our engagement with meaning is prior to and the foundation of subject-object knowledge, we turn now to
that prior phenomenon.
