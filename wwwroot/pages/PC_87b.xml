<b>2. <i>Misinterpretations of knowing as reaching from “inside” to “outside.”</i></b> Even if we were to define our engagement
with meaning in cognitive terms as “knowing objects,” we would still have to show how we are ontologically related
to the world. Usually we take ourselves as the knowers, and nature as the object to be known. The ability to know
belongs to us rather than to nature, but (1) not as some bodily property and (2) not as if we were objectively present
things.

<p id="PC_87b">
Since knowing is not external to us, we end up saying it is “inside” us, but not as a thing, whether physical or
mental. (In doing so, we think we are not employing unquestioned presuppositions.) We then set about trying to puzzle
out
</p>
<p id="PC_87b">
• how we get from “inside” to “outside”
</p>
<p id="PC_87b">
• how knowing can reach an object at all
</p>
<p id="PC_87b">
• how we know the object (and get it “inside” us) without changing our status as “inside.”
</p>
<p id="PC_87b" class="noindent">
All this is done, moreover, by presupposing but never questioning the being of the knower.
</p>
<p id="PC_87b">
Of course, we claim that this “inside” isn’t like a box (“the mind as a closet”), but otherwise we have nothing to
say about what this “immanence” is and how we “transcend” it and get outside. — In short, this approach leaves
unanswered the question of the being of knowing, i.e., <i>what and how knowing is</i>.
