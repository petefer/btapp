<b>8. <i>Being “in” the world of meaning is an ex-sistential.</i></b> Our a priori engagement with meaning [i.e., our being
“in” meaning] is an ex-sistential. It does not mean that I am spatially “inside” something. (That is not the original
meaning of the word “in.”)<sup>1 *</sup> As a finite form of “to be,” <sup>¶</sup> the “am” of “I am” connotes residing in and being
familiar with the world. <i>Thus being “in” meaning is the formal ex-sistential expression for the being of exsistence,
    <sup>¶</sup> and the fundamental structure of ex-sistence is engagement with meaning.</i>
