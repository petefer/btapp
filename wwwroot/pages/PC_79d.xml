<b>8. <i>Being “in” the world of meaning is an ex-sistential.</i></b> Our a priori engagement with meaning [i.e., our being
“in” meaning] is an ex-sistential. It does not mean that I am spatially “inside” something. (That is not the original
meaning of the word “in.”)<sup>1</sup>

Heidegger supplies the following etymology from Grimm. (The note in M-R 80, n.1 is informative).
• The German “in” is derived from the postulated strong verb “innan,” to reside or dwell, as in the Latin
habitare.
• The German “an” has the sense of being familiar with, accustomed to, or taking care of, as in the Latin
habitare, to dwell, and diligo, to care for, prize, esteem, love.
• The German for the English “am” is “bin” (connected with “bei”; cf. French chez), which evokes
“living in familiarity with.” At SZ 188d Heidegger summarizes all these meanings as: “Vertrautsein
mit”: being familiar with.">◊</span>
As a finite form of “to be,”
<span style="color:magenta;" title="“Being” [Sein] is also the infinitive form of “is”: something is.”">☞</span>
 the “am” of “I am” connotes residing in and being
familiar with the world. <i>Thus being “in” meaning is the formal ex-sistential expression for the being of exsistence,
<span style="color:magenta;" title="But it is not an expression for being in general and certainly—
and absolutely—not for being itself. [Ed. “Being itself” refers to the clearing/Seyn.]">☞</span>
and the fundamental structure of ex-sistence is engagement with meaning.</i>
