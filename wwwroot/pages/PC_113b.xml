<b>15. <i>Three aspects of the sign as a referral</i></b>
The purpose of the above has been to offer further support, via an analysis
of signs, for what §§ 15 and 16 demonstrated about <i>referral</i>. There are three elements to a sign qua referral:
<br/>
1. A sign serves to indicate or point out something: it <i>refers</i> to (e.g.) where one waits for the bus. Like all tools,
it has the referral-structure of “in order to….” It is referred-to-a-purpose.
<br/>
2. A sign belongs (together with other useful things) within a <i>set</i> of referrals.
<br/>
3. As useful, the sign makes the set of referrals accessible to foresight.
<br/>
In short, a sign is a useful thing which shows 
<i>what the structure of usefulness is, namely, a set of referrals that constitute a world of practical meaning. </i>
That fact is what constitutes the special status of signs as things we use with
concern and foresight.
<br/>
Clearly referral (1) is not itself a sign but is the ontological foundation of signs, and (2) is not an ontic aspect of
something useful but is what constitutes something as useful.
<br/>
<b>Transition</b>: We have argued that referral-to-a-purpose is the ontological basis of (and hence presupposed in) all
useful things. We now ask: (1) In what sense is that the case? and (2) How does referral constitute the very structure
of all worlds of practical meaning?
