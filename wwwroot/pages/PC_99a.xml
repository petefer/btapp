<b>7. <i>Theory and practice.</i></b>
Practical activity is not theoretical knowledge, but neither is it blind. The difference between
theory and practice is <i>not</i> (1) that theory <i>observes</i> whereas practice <i>acts</i> or (2) that practice <i>applies</i> theoretical
knowledge to practical ends. Both theory and practice are equally basic ways of being concerned with things, but
practical activity has its own kind of knowing. Theoretical knowing sees something, but <i>without</i> practical foresight
[into how to change it]. Absent such foresight, theory works with its own rules, which take the form of <i>method</i>.
