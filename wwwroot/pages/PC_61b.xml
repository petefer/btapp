<b>32. <i>We cannot just “look” at being but must wrest it from things.</i></b> We encounter being as a phenomenon by <i>wresting</i> it
from things. We need a proper method for three things: for the <i>starting point</i> of our analysis, for <i>getting access</i> to the
phenomenon, and for <i>piercing through</i> the cover-ups. The “originary,” “intuitive” grasping and explaining of
phenomena that we are proposing has nothing to do with the naïveté of an accidental, unmediated, unreflective “just
looking” at things.
