<b>32. <i>We cannot just “take a look” at being but must pull it out of things.</i></b> We encounter the being
of things as a phenomenon by <i>pulling it out</i> of things. We need the right method in order to properly
engage with three elements of that task:
<br/>
• the <i>starting point</i> of the analysis,
<br/>
• <i>accessing</i> the phenomenon, and
<br/>
• <i>cutting through</i> anything that covers it up.
<br/>
Our goal is to directly grasp and explain what we experience. However, this has nothing to do with
the naïveté of some unplanned, unmediated, and unreflective “taking a look” at things.
