<b>12. <i>The referral-structure of a job (3): the “for-whom” of production.</i></b> The product is designed for someone and with
someone in mind (who will buy it, use it, wear it, and so on) whether that be a particular person on “the general
market.” Therefore, in production we also encounter
<br/>
• other people who ex-sist like us;
<br/>
• their lived world of meaning in which they will buy and use the product and which we also share;
<br/>
• the public world we share
<br/>
• the shared environment, in which things are arranged for use, comfort, etc. (roads, buildings, lights).
<br/>
Take clocks, for example. They are use-objects that indirectly tell us about the position of the sun. They make even
the sun something useful for us. In short, whatever the task we are absorbed in, all such things are present in the task’s
referral-structure, and we understand them in varying degrees of explicitness and foresight.
