<b>6. <i>Our goal is not “subjective” or “common” worlds of meaning but the essential structure of meaning as such.</i></b>
Meaning is a characteristic of human beings alone. But someone might object: If every human being has “his or her
own world,” then the world of meaning becomes “subjective” and we lose a “common” world of meaning.

Our focus is not on either subjective or common worlds of meaning but on the <i>essence</i> of 
meaning—<i>the world of meaning as such</i>. How might we encounter that?
