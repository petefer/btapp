<b>8. <i>When a tool is unusable, the meaning-giving context shows up.</i></b> When a tool “stands out” as damaged, missing,
or in the way, I still understand its usefulness, at least implicitly; I can still perceive it even as it recedes into the
background. At that point the meaning-giving context of the tool comes into view.
