<b>4. <i>Tools that are unusable.</i></b>
When I need a hammer that happens to be missing, I can’t use <i>other</i> tools—for example,
nails. So, the nails “stand out” as having lost their current usefulness: they are “just there” in the box. The more I feel
the need for the missing hammer, the more the nails stand out as having lost usefulness. They just stare back at me as
if to say: “Can’t be used.” With that, my interest in them takes on a <i>privative</i> cast: I see these once useful things as
“just there” and no more.
