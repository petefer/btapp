<b>12. <i>SZ II.2: Descartes.</i></b> In taking over Cartesian subjectivity, Kant decisive failure lay in omitting an ontology of exsistence.
Descartes’ “radical” new foundation for philosophy (“I think, therefore I am”) had neglected to work out the
meaning of the being of the “I am.” In SZ II.2 we will (1) lay out that unexpressed foundations of Descartes’
<i>cogito ergo sum</i> and will (2) show how those very foundations—particularly his notion of the <i>cogito</i>’s absolute “certitude”—
made him completely miss the question of being that goes with human being.
