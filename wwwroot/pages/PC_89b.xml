<b>5. <i>Ex-sistence is already “outside” with no “inside.”</i></b> Knowledge is not a matter of making a sortie from some inner
closet, dashing outside, grabbing something, and dragging it back into some “closet of the mind.” We are already
“outside” with whatever we encounter; but that “outside” is actually “inside” meaning, which is where we encounter
objects. As “inside meaning,” we always remain “outside” with things, precisely as ex-sistence. Likewise when I go
on to reflect on the thing that I have come to know—or even when I forget it—I am just as much “outside” as when I
first grasped it. Completely forgetting something, getting it wrong, or even being deluded about it: all these are
modifications of being “outside” in meaning.
