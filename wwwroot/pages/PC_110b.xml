<b>8. <i>Two ways we can engage with a turn-signal.</i></b>
To discover what “indicating” means, we analyze how we <i>deal</i> with
signs and specifically with their <i>usefulness</i>.
<br/>
Say I’m standing on the corner, and I see a car approaching with its left turn-signal blinking. The driver is
suggesting that pedestrians and other cars pay attention to the direction they are going in. Attending to the direction
I’m walking in is one way I behave (i.e., am) in my current world of meaning. (We are always “on our way” in one
direction or another; waiting or standing still is only a limit-case of being on one’s way.)
<br/>
<b><i>A lived engagement.</i></b> The turn-signal is addressed specifically to my “spatiality,” and I understand what the
blinking signal means not by just staring at it and not by just looking towards the left of the car and noticing o
objectively present things. Rather, the turn-signal is addressed to my <i>foresight</i> and to the way I’m <i>dealing</i> with the
intersection—i.e., my interest in crossing the street. The blinking signal brings to my attention the “lived space” of
the whole intersection. I don’t focus on the turn-signal; instead, I <i>orient myself within the intersection</i>.
<br/>
<b><i>A detached engagement.</i></b> On the other hand, I can focus on the turn-signal as just an interesting piece of equipment
on the car. In so doing, I will not necessarily see it as something <i>useful</i>, and I may not even see it as <i>indicating</i>
anything. (I may just think it “looks nice.”) But even so, I don’t see it as a “mere thing” (“a blinking red light”) or
even as “one useful thing among others.” Rather, it has its own <i>definiteness</i>.
