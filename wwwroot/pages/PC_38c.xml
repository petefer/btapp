SZ I.1 is both an <i>incomplete</i> and a <i>provisional</i> analysis of ex-sistence: it merely <i>lays out</i> the structures of exsistence’s
way of being while leaving the <i>interpretation</i> of those structures for SZ I.2. SZ I.1 merely prepares for
establishing ex-sistence’s temporality as the horizon [in § 65 [on temporality]. SZ I.1 merely prepares for
establishing temporality. Thereafter [in SZ I.2, chapter 4] we will <i>reinterpret</i> the structures of SZ I.1 at a more
advanced and properly ontological level.<sup>n</sup>
