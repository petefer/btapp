SZ I.1 is both an <i>incomplete</i> and a <i>provisional</i> analysis of ex-sistence: it merely <i>lays out</i> the structures of exsistence’s
way of being while leaving the <i>interpretation</i> of those structures for SZ I.2. SZ I.1 merely prepares for
establishing ex-sistence’s temporality as the horizon [in § 65 [on temporality]. SZ I.1 merely prepares for
establishing temporality. Thereafter [in SZ I.2, chapter 4] we will <i>reinterpret</i> the structures of SZ I.1 at a more
advanced and properly ontological level.
<span title="Even though SZ I.2, chapter 4,
gives a renewed interpretation of the structures of ex-sistence laid out in SZ I.1, that renewed interpretation will have
to be “repeated once again” (“eine erneute Wiederholung,” SZ 333.36-37 = 382.31-32, § 66, ¶ 5) after SZ I.3, when
the question of being has been adequately resolved. Cf. SZ 436.23-25 = 487.4-6 (Durchführung) and GA 14: 40.13-
15 = 32.12-14 (ursprünglich. . . wiederholt werden).">◊</span>
