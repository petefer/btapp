<b>2. <i>Descartes overlooked the “sum” in “cogito ergo sum.”</i></b> We could begin with Descartes, who is credited with
starting modern philosophy by discovering the <i>cogito sum</i> [“I think, therefore, I am”]. He studied the cogito but
entirely neglected the <i>sum</i>, the “I am,” even though the <i>sum</i> is just as basic as the <i>cogito</i>. By contrast, the present
studyasks about the <i>sum</i>. Only if we establish its nature can we understand any <i>cogitationes</i> [thoughts].
