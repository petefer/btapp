<b>1. <i>The theme of the book. The question of method.</i></b> The thematic object here is the being of things or the intelligibility
of being in general.<sup>n</sup> With that, the method <i>seems</i> to be already prescribed—ontology seeks to make the being of things
stand out and [then] to explain being itself—but the methods governing traditional ontologies are highly questionable.
We are using “ontology” here in a formally broad sense and will not try to clarify its method by merely tracing out its
history.<sup>n</sup>
