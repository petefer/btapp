<b>1. <i>The theme of the book and the question of method.</i></b> The thematic object of this study is the
being of things, specifically how that being is intelligible. Therefore, it might seem that we have
already decided on the method: that of traditional ontology. All ontology aims at making the being
of things stand out and then explaining being itself.

sentence moves (1) from the being of things (= the focus of traditional ontology) to how
being/significance is understandable at all (= the task of SZ).">◊</span>
However, the traditional methods for doing
ontology are very questionable, and our own approach has nothing to do with them.

Heidegger had stated: “It is my conviction that philosophy is at an end. We stand before completely
new tasks that have nothing to do with traditional philosophy” (GA 17: 1.16-19 = 1.14-16).">◊</span>
(We forego
the task of tracing out the history of those methods.)
