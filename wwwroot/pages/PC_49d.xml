        <i>The theme of the book and the question of method.</i>
    </b>
    The thematic object of this study is the
being of things, specifically how that being is intelligible. Therefore, it might seem that we have
already decided on the method: that of traditional ontology. All ontology aims at making the being
of things stand out and then explaining being itself.

        <a href="https://www.beyng.com/btapp/page/49">M-R 49</a>.25ff. reverses the order of the German 
(“Die Abhebung des Seins vom Seienden und die Explikation des Seins selbst,” 
<a href="https://www.beyng.com/pages/de/SeinUndZeit/SeinUndZeit.029.html">SZ 29</a>.8f) 
and thereby changes the meaning. 
Heidegger's sentence moves (1) from the being of <i>things</i> (= the focus of traditional ontology) 
to how being/significance is understandable at all (= the task of SZ).

    However, the traditional methods for doing
ontology are very questionable, and our own approach has nothing to do with them.

        In October 1923 Heidegger had stated:
“It is my conviction that philosophy is at an end. We stand before completely
new tasks that have nothing to do with traditional philosophy”
