<b>10. <i>Setting up a sign.</i></b>
This becomes clear when we actually set up a sign. We do this with foresight and purpose and
in such a way that the sign is able to always manifest <i>the relevant world of meaning</i>. But above, at SZ 75d, we said
that a tool usually “holds itself in” and does not “stand out.” In the present case, however, the sign, <i>as</i> a sign, 
<i>has to be conspicuous</i>. Conspicuous, yes, and readily accessible—but not as something objectively present.
