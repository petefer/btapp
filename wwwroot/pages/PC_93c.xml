<b>10. <i>No. 2: “world” as the being of a set of things.</i></b> In general, “the world of X” refers to the <i>being</i> of all X’s, i.e., the
context that <i>gives meaning</i> to that specific set of things. For example, if we speak of “mathematics” as constituting
“the world of the mathematician,” we mean “mathematics” as the context that gives meaning to all possible
mathematical objects.
