<b>“Alreadiness” and the past.</b> 
<span title="This issue—which is crucial for understanding how the a priori functions in
Heidegger—is frequently misunderstood. It is bound up with how Heidegger adapts to his own purposes Aristotle’s
concept of τὸ τί ἦν εἶναι / to ti ēn einai. On that, see below, § 18, Editor’s note to: ¶ 5, [re Heidegger’s marginal
note] the “a priori perfect” nature of ex-sistence, as well as § 65 on temporality.
By way of anticipation: We are always already (a priori) our essence-qua-Existenz, or as Heidegger puts it here
(channeling Aristotle’s τὸ τί ἦν εἶναι): our “wie und ‘was’ es [= Dasein] schon war.” Here the verb “war” (English
“was”) does not have the sense of the past tense; rather, as combined with “schon” or “je schon,” it bespeaks “what
always already [= a priori/ ontologically] is the case” as at SZ 76b (76.11) and 325d (326.1). This is what Heidegger
calls the “a priori perfect” or “ontological perfect” nature of ex-istence: see SZ § 18, ¶ 5 (85.17) and GA 2: 114, note.">◊</span>
Factically I always am “what” and how I <i>already</i> am [“wie und ‘was’ es schon war”].
This entails that, whether I am aware of it or not, I always already am my <i>past</i>—but not like some possession that I drag
along behind me
<span title="This phrase (“‘hinter’ ihm herschiebt,” SZ 20.7) recalls another from
Heidegger’s review of Jasper’s Psychologie der Weltanschauungen, GA 9: 3.32 = 27.25: “eine mitgeschleppte
Beigabe.”">◊</span>
 that still occasionally affects me. No, I <i>am</i> my past: it is an element of my way of being. Moreover, (to
put it roughly) my past “happens” from out of my future.
<span title="The past is not the same as “alreadiness” (one’s essence as das
Gewesene). Whereas one’s past “happens” from out of one’s futurity, one’s futurity is based in and generated from
out of one’s alreadiness: SZ 344b: “aus ihr [= Gewesenheit] erst Zukunft und Gegenwart sich zeitigen.”">◊</span>
<br/>
Regardless of how I now am and currently understand my ex-sistence, I have grown up <i>into</i> and <i>in</i> an <i>inherited</i>
way of understanding myself. That is how I first and foremost understand myself, it’s how I see and regulate my
possibilities. My inherited past—which is always <i>social</i>, i.e., the past of my “generation” (Dilthey)—does not follow
along <i>behind</i> me but always already goes <i>ahead</i> of me.<span title="Alreadingess (das Gewesene) always goes ahead of ex-sistence (“west ihr stets
voraus”: GA 11: 58.3). Likewise, thrownness does not lie “behind” ex-sistence (“liegt nicht hinter ihm,” SZ 284b).
