<b>8. <i>The third element of the question about being.</i></b> Thirdly, <i>das Befragte</i>. We are asking about being, but
being is always the being <i>of things</i>. Hence the subject matter we start with is things: whatever has being.
We are asking <i>about</i> their being, i.e., how the <i>are</i> in themselves.

Such things must be already accessible, and we must be sure we have the right access to them. There
are two issues here:<br />
1. The various way something can <i>be</i>—for example:<br />
  • <i>what</i> it is<br />
  • <i>how</i> it is<br />
  • <i>that</i> it is<br />
  • its being <i>real</i><br />
  • its <i>objectively present</i><br />
  • its <i>subsisting</i> (in the case of numbers)<br />
  • its being <i>valid</i><br />
  • its <i>existing</i><sup>5</sup><br />
  • even the fact that “there-is” (<i>es gibt</i>) such and such a thing.<br />
2. What specific thing should we start with in order to find out how being is intelligible?<sup>6</sup> Does any specific
thing stand out as exemplary7 in manifesting being? And if so, why would it have priority?
