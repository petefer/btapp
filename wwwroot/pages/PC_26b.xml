<b>8. <i>The third element of the question about being.</i></b> Thirdly, <i>das Befragte</i>. We are asking about being, but
being is always the being <i>of things</i>. Hence the subject matter we start with is things: whatever <i>has being</i>.
We are asking <i>about</i> their being, i.e., how the <i>are</i> in themselves.

<p id="PC_26b">
Such things must be already accessible, and we must be sure we have the right access to them. There
are two issues here:<br />
1. The various way something can <i>be</i>—for example:<br />
  • <i>what</i> it is<br />
  • <i>how</i> it is<br />
  • <i>that</i> it is<br />
  • its being <i>real</i><br />
  • its <i>objectively present</i><br />
  • its <i>subsisting</i> (in the case of numbers)<br />
  • its being <i>valid</i><br />
  • its <i>existing</i><sup>¶</sup><br />
  • even the fact that “there-is” (<i>es gibt</i>) such and such a thing.<br />
2. What specific thing should we start with in order to find out how being is intelligible?<sup>¶</sup> Does any specific
thing stand out as exemplary<sup>¶</sup> in manifesting being? And if so, why would it have priority?

¶ 8, <b>its existing</b>: This is still the usual concept [of existing] and not yet a different one [viz., Heidegger’s
own sense of “ex-sistence.”]<br />
¶ 8, <b>how being is intelligible</b>: Here two different questions are lined up together. It could be
misunderstood, especially regarding the role of ex-sistence.<br />
¶ 8, <b>stand out as exemplary</b>: This is misleading. Ex-sistence is exemplary insofar as its essence is to
sustain the disclosedness of being, and thus it has a co-role to play [Bei-spiel] in bringing being as such into
play regarding its resonance.” [<b>Ed</b>. Re resonance/<i>Anklang</i> cf. GA 65: 107ff. = ET 85ff. and GA 71: 75-88 =
ET 63-66.]
