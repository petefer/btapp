<b>4. <i>“Objective knowledge” is a privative@privative mode of our engagement with meaning.</i></b> The evidence shows that
knowing objects is based on, and presupposes, our prior engagement with meaning, which constitutes our very existence. 
We do not just stare at objectively present things. Rather, we are <i>fascinated</i> by them, and “just looking at”
stuff is a <i>privative</i> @ privative mode of our caring about things.

If we bracket out practicial activity (dealing with things, doing a job, etc.), we’re left with our “mere presence”
to things. We can encounter them merely in terms of “how they look” (εἶδος), and this detached observing of things
can turn into an explicit way of regarding the world. <sup>¶</sup> We adopt an “objective viewpoint,” take up an independent
stance “next to” them, and reduce our engagement to “perceiving” them. We may then talk about them as they are “in
themselves,” then interpret and define them, and finally make propositional statements about them that we can store
up.

This is one way of being engaged with meaning. However, it should not be interpreted as “going outside” to
gather “images” of things that we store up “inside” and then wonder how they might “agree” with things “outside.
