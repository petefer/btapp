<b>10. <i>Touch.</i></b> As engaged with meaning, we are not objectively present with thing, standing “alongside” them in
the world. We often say, for example, “The table touches the wall,” but strictly speaking objectively present
things cannot “touch” anything, no matter how close they may be to it, because they cannot <i>encounter</i> anything.
<br/>
Only ex-sistence can <i>touch</i> something—because only we are already engaged with meaning; that is, the
world of meaning is <i>already open</i> to us
<span title="Literally, “the world is already revealed to us” [“schon so
etwas wie Welt ihm entdeckt ist”]. Which meaning of world” does Heidegger intend here?
• The word “world” could have two meanings here:
1. the meaningful context within which we find things: this is Heidegger’s proper meaning of the
term;
2. the things that are meaningful within such a context: when he intends this meaning, Heidegger
usually puts the word in scare quotes: “Welt” / “world.”
• The proper corresponding verbs for “opening up” each of these distinct phenomena are:
1. erschließen, to dis-close or open up the world of meaning; and
2. entdecken, to dis-cover or render meaningfully present within a meaningful context.
Here (SZ 55.16), the word Welt appears without scare quotes but with the averb “entdecken.” I interpret the
term as having the first meaning.">◊</span>
and from out of that realm things can appear <i>as</i> objectively present
and touchable. Things that lack a world of meaning
<span title="Literally things that are “weltlos.” Heidegger famously said, “1.
a stone (a material thing) is worldless; 2. animals are poor in world [weltarm]; man is world-forming
[weltbildend” (GA 29/30: 263.24-26 = 177.41-42).">◊</span>
can neither touch each other nor be “with” one another.
<br/>
<i>Facticity</i>. We could say that ex-sistence, too, is “inside” the world of meaning and is objectively present—
but only if we completely bracket out the engagement with meaning. However, there is <i>another and proper</i>
sense in which we might speak of the “fact” of our ex-sistence<sup>2</sup>—not as the “factuality” [<i>Tatsächlichkeit</i>] of the
objectively present but as the <i>facticity</i> [<i>Faktizität</i>] of ex-sistence, a complicated structure that will become clear
later.
<br/>
To anticipate: While in one sense we are merely “within” the world of meaning, our engagement with
meaning entails much more, namely, that our “fate” is inextricably bound up with the meaning of the things we
encounter in our own worlds of meaning.
<span title="This “fate” (German: Geschick) has nothing to do
with fatality or some pre-determined “destiny” and everything to do with “thrownness” (Geworfenheit).
Thrownness is about the a priori (= always already operative) “givenness” of ex-sistence, i.e., the fact that it
always finds itself (initially not by its own choice) already (1) embedded in various worlds of meaning—e.g,
that of one’ parents or family—and (2) related to a given range of things (SZ 221d; 135d). The fact of such
givenness/Geschick underlies Heidegger’s notions both of the historicity of ex-sistence (§ 74, below) and the
so-called “sendings” or “dispensations” (Geschicke) of various instances of the clearing (cf. die Geschichte des
Seyns).">◊</span>
