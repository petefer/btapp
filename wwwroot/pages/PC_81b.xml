<b>10. <i>Touch.</i></b> As engaged with meaning, we are not objectively present with thing, standing “alongside” them in
the world. We often say, for example, “The table touches the wall,” but strictly speaking objectively present
things cannot “touch” anything, no matter how close they may be to it, because they cannot <i>encounter</i> anything.
<br/>
Only ex-sistence can <i>touch</i> something—because only we are already engaged with meaning; that is, the
world of meaning is <i>already open</i> to us<sup>*</sup> and from out of that realm things can appear <i>as</i> objectively present
and touchable. Things that lack a world of meaning<sup>*</sup> can neither touch each other nor be “with” one another.
<br/>
<i>Facticity</i>. We could say that ex-sistence, too, is “inside” the world of meaning and is objectively present—
but only if we completely bracket out the engagement with meaning. However, there is <i>another and proper</i>
sense in which we might speak of the “fact” of our ex-sistence<sup>2</sup>—not as the “factuality” [<i>Tatsächlichkeit</i>] of the
objectively present but as the <i>facticity</i> [<i>Faktizität</i>] of ex-sistence, a complicated structure that will become clear
later.
<br/>
To anticipate: While in one sense we are merely “within” the world of meaning, our engagement with
meaning entails much more, namely, that our “fate” is inextricably bound up with the meaning of the things we
encounter in our own worlds of meaning. <sup>*</sup>
