<b>¶ 2 A review of resolve. The “whence” of authentic possibilities
<br/>
<i>A. Review of resolve</i><br/>
1. Resolve is one’s silent self-understanding as “guilty” (i.e., thrown), and as prepared for the experience of dread.<br/>
2. Resolve gets its authenticity by anticipating death.<br/>
3. Resolve is understanding oneself as mortal possibility (“in the teeth of death”) and taking over one’s wholeness, i.e., one’s thrownness.<br/>
4. Taking over one’s mortal openness entails resolve about one’s situation<br/>
<i>B. What SZ §74 does not discuss</i><br/>
5. It does not discuss concrete choices in particular situations.<br/>
6. Nor does it discuss the structural-existential projection underlying a concrete possibility.<br/>
<i>C. But SZ §74 does discuss the source of authentic possibilities</i><br/>
7. This section will discuss the “whence” of the concrete possibilities that [resolute] Dasein can choose from and understand itself in.<br/>
<i>D. Where do Dasein’s authentic possibilities come from?</i><br/>
8. Anticipation of death guarantees only the wholeness and authenticity of resolve.<br/>
9. Those concrete possibilities do not come from death,<br/>
10. even when I actually return to my mortal openness rather than just speculating about death.<br/>
11. Hypothesis: The place whence I get those possibilities is disclosed as I take over my thrownness.<br/>
12. I cannot get behind my thrownness.<br/>
13. So before deciding whether I get my authentic possibilities from thrownness, I need a full conception of thrownness as an element of care (Sorge).<br/>
