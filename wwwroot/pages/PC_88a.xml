<b>3. <i>The so-called “problem of knowledge.”</i></b> This usual approach via “knowing objects” overlooks the prior fact that
that we are already engaged with meaning and that knowing is only <i>one</i> form of that engagement.
<br/>
<b>A possible objection:</b> But if knowing were already “out there,” “present with” the things that are to be
known, there would be no such thing as the famous “problem of knowledge”! i.e., the problem of how we transcend
our subjectivity and encounter the object. But (so it is said) there is such a problem.
<br/>
<b>A response:</b> This objection is a mere construct. It makes assumptions it cannot account for. Who says there
is such a problem? And what higher authority gets to decide the answer? The only authority we follow is that of
experience, which prompts the questions: What <i>is</i> knowing? and What kind of <i>being</i> does the knower have?
