<b>3. <i>The sciences progress by questioning the basic structures and concepts of being.</i></b> “Being” is always the
being of a thing, i.e., what-and-how a thing is.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;• Things may be divided into various regions (e.g., history, nature, space, life, ex-sistence,
language).<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;• In turn, these regions can become the subject matter of specific ontic sciences.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;• But pre-scientifically, i.e., in our everyday experience, we have already worked out, implicitly, the
basic structures of such regions [e.g., we know the difference between “nature” and “human
history”].<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;• The sciences then demarcate and fix these regions explicitly by establishing the basic concepts
[Grundbegriffe] that guide how the sciences make sense of those regions.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;• In turn, real progress in the sciences is achieved not merely by acquiring new data but more
importantly by how the sciences call those basic structures and concepts into question.
