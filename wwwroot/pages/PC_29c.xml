<b>3. <i>The sciences progress by questioning the basic structures and concepts of being.</i></b> “Being” is always the
being <i>of a thing</i>, i.e., what-and-how a thing is.<br />
  • Things may be divided into various <i>regions</i> (e.g., history, nature, space, life, ex-sistence,
language).<br />
  • In turn, these regions can become the subject matter of <i>specific ontic sciences</i>.<br />
  • But <i>pre</i>-scientifically, i.e., in our everyday experience, we have already worked out, <i>implicitly</i>, the
basic structures of such regions [e.g., we know the difference between “nature” and “human
history”].<br />
  • The sciences then demarcate and fix these regions <i>explicitly</i> by establishing the basic concepts
[<i>Grundbegriffe</i>] that guide how the sciences make sense of those regions.<br />
  • In turn, real progress in the sciences is achieved not merely by acquiring new data but more
importantly by how the sciences call those basic structures and concepts into question.
